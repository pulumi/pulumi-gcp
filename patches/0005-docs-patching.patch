+* Creating or updating an environment resource can take up to one hour. In addition, GCP may only

+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+
+* `certificate` -
+  (Required)
+  The certificate in PEM format.
+  The certificate chain must be no greater than 5 certs long.
+  The chain must include at least one intermediate cert.
+  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
+
+* `private_key` -
+  (Required)
+  The write-only private key in PEM format.
+  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
+
+
+- - -
+
+
+* `description` -
+  (Optional)
+  An optional description of this resource.
+
+* `name` -
+  (Optional)
+  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
+  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
+  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
+  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
+  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
+  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
+  character, which cannot be a dash.
+
+  These are in the same namespace as the managed SSL certificates.
+
+* `region` -
+  (Optional)
+  The Region in which the created regional ssl certificate should reside.
+  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
+
+* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
+    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
+
+* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the
+ specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/sslCertificates/{{name}}`
+
+* `creation_timestamp` -
+  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
+
+* `expire_time` -
+  Expire time of the certificate in RFC3339 text format.
+
+* `certificate_id` -
+  The unique identifier for the resource.
+* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.
+
+
+## Timeouts
+
+This resource provides the following
+[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:
+
+- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
+- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

 ## Note on "destroy" / "apply"
-There are many types of Dataflow jobs.  Some Dataflow jobs run constantly, getting new data from (e.g.) a GCS bucket, and outputting data continuously.  Some jobs process a set amount of data then terminate.  All jobs can fail while running due to programming errors or other issues.  In this way, Dataflow jobs are different from most other Terraform / Google resources.

+There are many types of Dataflow jobs.  Some Dataflow jobs run constantly, getting new data from (e.g.) a GCS bucket, and outputting data continuously.  Some jobs process a set amount of data then terminate.  All jobs can fail while running due to programming errors or other issues.  In this way, Dataflow jobs are different from most other Google resources.
 
 The Dataflow resource is considered 'existing' while it is in a nonterminal state.  If it reaches a terminal state (e.g. 'FAILED', 'COMPLETE', 'CANCELLED'), it will be recreated on the next 'apply'.  This is as expected for jobs which run continuously, but may surprise users who use this resource for other kinds of Dataflow jobs.
 
-A Dataflow job which is 'destroyed' may be "cancelled" or "drained".  If "cancelled", the job terminates - any data written remains where it is, but no new data will be processed.  If "drained", no new data will enter the pipeline, but any data currently in the pipeline will finish being processed.  The default is "drain". When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `terraform destroy` to complete.

When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `pulumi destroy` to complete.
 
 You can potentially short-circuit the wait by setting `skip_wait_on_job_termination` to `true`, but beware that unless you take active steps to ensure that the job `name` parameter changes between instances, the name will conflict and the launch of the new job will fail. One way to do this is with a [random_id](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/id) resource, for example:

+
+Allows creation and management of a single binding within IAM policy for
+an existing Google Cloud Platform folder.
+
+~> **Note:** This resource _must not_ be used in conjunction with
+   `google_folder_iam_policy` or they will fight over what your policy
+   should be.
+
+~> **Note:** On create, this resource will overwrite members of any existing roles.
+    Use `pulumi import` and inspect the output to ensure
+    your existing members are preserved.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_folder" "department1" {
+  display_name = "Department 1"
+  parent       = "organizations/1234567"
+}

+  role   = "roles/editor"
+
+  members = [
+    "user:alice@gmail.com",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `folder` - (Required) The resource name of the folder the policy is attached to. Its format is folders/{folder_id}.
+
+* `members` (Required) - An array of identities that will be granted the privilege in the `role`.
+  Each entry can have one of the following values:
+  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that is associated with a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com.
+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
+  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
+  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
+  * For more details on format and restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/Policy#Binding
+
+* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
+    `google_folder_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
+    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
+exported:
+
+* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the folder's IAM policy.
+
+## Import
+
+IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `folder` and role, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import google_folder_iam_binding.viewer "folder-name roles/viewer"
+```
+
+-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM binding with a custom role, make sure to use the
+ full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

+
+# google\_organization\_iam\_audit\_config
+
+Allows management of audit logging config for a given service for a Google Cloud Platform Organization.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_organization_iam_audit_config" "config" {
+  org_id = "your-organization-id"
+  service = "allServices"
+  audit_log_config {
+    log_type = "DATA_READ"
+    exempted_members = [
+      "user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com",
+    ]
+  }
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `org_id` - (Required) The numeric ID of the organization in which you want to manage the audit logging config.
+
+* `service` - (Required) Service which will be enabled for audit logging.  The special value `allServices` covers all services.  Note that if there are google\_organization\_iam\_audit\_config resources covering both `allServices` and a specific service then the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the `log_types` specified in each `audit_log_config` are enabled, and the `exempted_members` in each `audit_log_config` are exempted.
+
+* `audit_log_config` - (Required) The configuration for logging of each type of permission.  This can be specified multiple times.  Structure is documented below.
+
+---
+
+The `audit_log_config` block supports:
+
+* `log_type` - (Required) Permission type for which logging is to be configured.  Must be one of `DATA_READ`, `DATA_WRITE`, or `ADMIN_READ`.
+
+* `exempted_members` - (Optional) Identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission.
+  Each entry can have one of the following values:
+  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
+  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
+  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
+
+## Import
+IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
+
+```
+terraform import google_organization_iam_audit_config.config "your-organization-id foo.googleapis.com"

+# google\_organization\_iam\_binding
+
+Allows creation and management of a single binding within IAM policy for
+an existing Google Cloud Platform Organization.
+
+~> **Note:** This resource __must not__ be used in conjunction with
+   `google_organization_iam_member` for the __same role__ or they will fight over
+   what your policy should be.
+
+~> **Note:** On create, this resource will overwrite members of any existing roles.
+    Use `pulumi import` and inspect the `output to ensure
+    your existing members are preserved.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_organization_iam_binding" "binding" {
+  org_id = "123456789"
+  role    = "roles/browser"
+
+  members = [
+    "user:alice@gmail.com",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `org_id` - (Required) The numeric ID of the organization in which you want to create a custom role.
+
+* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
+    `google_organization_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
+    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
+
+* `members` - (Required) A list of users that the role should apply to. For more details on format and restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/Policy#Binding
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
+exported:
+
+* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the organization's IAM policy.
+
+## Import
+
+IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `org_id` and role, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import google_organization_iam_binding.my_org "your-org-id roles/viewer"
+```
+
+-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
+ full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

 Permissions can be granted either by ACLs or Cloud IAM policies. In general, permissions granted by Cloud IAM policies do not appear in ACLs, and permissions granted by ACLs do not appear in Cloud IAM policies. The only exception is for ACLs applied directly on a bucket and certain bucket-level Cloud IAM policies, as described in [Cloud IAM relation to ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam#acls).
