-    Terraform does not manage these underlying resources. For example, in Cloud 
-    Composer 2, this includes a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud Storage, and 
-    Compute networking resources.
-* Creating or updating an environment usually takes around 25 minutes.
-* In some cases errors in the configuration will be detected and reported only 
-    during the process of the environment creation. If you encounter such 
-    errors, please verify your configuration is valid against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs for the Terraform provider.

+We **STRONGLY** recommend you read the [GCP
+guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to) as the Environment resource requires a long
+deployment process and involves several layers of GCP infrastructure, including a Kubernetes Engine
+cluster, Cloud Storage, and Compute networking resources. Due to limitations of the API, Pulumi
+will not be able to find or manage many of these underlying resources automatically. In particular:
+* Creating or updating an environment resource can take up to one hour. In addition, GCP may only
+  detect some errors in the configuration when they are used (e.g., ~40-50 minutes into the creation
+  process), and is prone to limited error reporting. If you encounter confusing or uninformative
+  errors, please verify your configuration is valid against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs
+  against the provider.
+* **Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that are not automatically cleaned up** on environment deletion. [More about Composer's use of Cloud
+  Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage).
+* Please review the [known
+  issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/known-issues) for Composer if you are having

+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+
+* `certificate` -
+  (Required)
+  The certificate in PEM format.
+  The certificate chain must be no greater than 5 certs long.
+  The chain must include at least one intermediate cert.
+  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
+
+* `private_key` -
+  (Required)
+  The write-only private key in PEM format.
+  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
+
+
+- - -
+
+
+* `description` -
+  (Optional)
+  An optional description of this resource.
+
+* `name` -
+  (Optional)
+  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
+  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
+  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
+  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
+  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
+  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
+  character, which cannot be a dash.
+
+  These are in the same namespace as the managed SSL certificates.
+
+* `region` -
+  (Optional)
+  The Region in which the created regional ssl certificate should reside.
+  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
+
+* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
+    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
+
+* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the
+ specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:
+
+* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/sslCertificates/{{name}}`
+
+* `creation_timestamp` -
+  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
+
+* `expire_time` -
+  Expire time of the certificate in RFC3339 text format.
+
+* `certificate_id` -
+  The unique identifier for the resource.
+* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.
+
+
+## Timeouts

 ## Note on "destroy" / "apply"
-There are many types of Dataflow jobs.  Some Dataflow jobs run constantly, getting new data from (e.g.) a GCS bucket, and outputting data continuously.  Some jobs process a set amount of data then terminate.  All jobs can fail while running due to programming errors or other issues.  In this way, Dataflow jobs are different from most other Terraform / Google resources.

+There are many types of Dataflow jobs.  Some Dataflow jobs run constantly, getting new data from (e.g.) a GCS bucket, and outputting data continuously.  Some jobs process a set amount of data then terminate.  All jobs can fail while running due to programming errors or other issues.  In this way, Dataflow jobs are different from most other Google resources.
 
 The Dataflow resource is considered 'existing' while it is in a nonterminal state.  If it reaches a terminal state (e.g. 'FAILED', 'COMPLETE', 'CANCELLED'), it will be recreated on the next 'apply'.  This is as expected for jobs which run continuously, but may surprise users who use this resource for other kinds of Dataflow jobs.
 
-A Dataflow job which is 'destroyed' may be "cancelled" or "drained".  If "cancelled", the job terminates - any data written remains where it is, but no new data will be processed.  If "drained", no new data will enter the pipeline, but any data currently in the pipeline will finish being processed.  The default is "drain". When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `terraform destroy` to complete.

When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `pulumi destroy` to complete.
 
 You can potentially short-circuit the wait by setting `skip_wait_on_job_termination` to `true`, but beware that unless you take active steps to ensure that the job `name` parameter changes between instances, the name will conflict and the launch of the new job will fail. One way to do this is with a [random_id](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/id) resource, for example:

+  ]
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `folder` - (Required) The resource name of the folder the policy is attached to. Its format is folders/{folder_id}.
+
+* `members` (Required) - An array of identities that will be granted the privilege in the `role`.
+  Each entry can have one of the following values:
+  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that is associated with a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com.
+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
+  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
+  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
+  * For more details on format and restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/Policy#Binding
+
+* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
+    `google_folder_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
+    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
+exported:
+
+* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the folder's IAM policy.
+
+## Import
+
+IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `folder` and role, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import google_folder_iam_binding.viewer "folder-name roles/viewer"
+```
+
+-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM binding with a custom role, make sure to use the
+ full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

+
+# google\_organization\_iam\_audit\_config
+
+Allows management of audit logging config for a given service for a Google Cloud Platform Organization.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_organization_iam_audit_config" "config" {
+  org_id = "your-organization-id"
+  service = "allServices"
+  audit_log_config {
+    log_type = "DATA_READ"
+    exempted_members = [
+      "user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com",
+    ]
+  }
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `org_id` - (Required) The numeric ID of the organization in which you want to manage the audit logging config.
+
+* `service` - (Required) Service which will be enabled for audit logging.  The special value `allServices` covers all services.  Note that if there are google\_organization\_iam\_audit\_config resources covering both `allServices` and a specific service then the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the `log_types` specified in each `audit_log_config` are enabled, and the `exempted_members` in each `audit_log_config` are exempted.
+
+* `audit_log_config` - (Required) The configuration for logging of each type of permission.  This can be specified multiple times.  Structure is documented below.
+
+---
+
+The `audit_log_config` block supports:
+
+* `log_type` - (Required) Permission type for which logging is to be configured.  Must be one of `DATA_READ`, `DATA_WRITE`, or `ADMIN_READ`.
+
+* `exempted_members` - (Optional) Identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission.
+  Each entry can have one of the following values:
+  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
+  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
+  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
+
+## Import
+IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
+
+```
+terraform import google_organization_iam_audit_config.config "your-organization-id foo.googleapis.com"

+# google\_organization\_iam\_binding
+
+Allows creation and management of a single binding within IAM policy for
+an existing Google Cloud Platform Organization.
+
+~> **Note:** This resource __must not__ be used in conjunction with
+   `google_organization_iam_member` for the __same role__ or they will fight over
+   what your policy should be.
+
+~> **Note:** On create, this resource will overwrite members of any existing roles.
+    Use `pulumi import` and inspect the `output to ensure
+    your existing members are preserved.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_organization_iam_binding" "binding" {
+  org_id = "123456789"
+  role    = "roles/browser"
+
+  members = [
+    "user:alice@gmail.com",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `org_id` - (Required) The numeric ID of the organization in which you want to create a custom role.
+
+* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
+    `google_organization_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
+    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
+
+* `members` - (Required) A list of users that the role should apply to. For more details on format and restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/Policy#Binding
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
+exported:
+
+* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the organization's IAM policy.
+
+## Import
+
+IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `org_id` and role, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import google_organization_iam_binding.my_org "your-org-id roles/viewer"
+```
+
+-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
+ full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
