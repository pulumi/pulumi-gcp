-There are many types of Dataflow jobs.  Some Dataflow jobs run constantly, getting new data from (e.g.) a GCS bucket, and outputting data continuously.

Some jobs process a set amount of data then terminate.  All jobs can fail while running due to programming errors or other issues.  In this way, Dataflow jobs are different from most other Google resources.
 
 The Dataflow resource is considered 'existing' while it is in a nonterminal state.  If it reaches a terminal state (e.g. 'FAILED', 'COMPLETE', 'CANCELLED'), it will be recreated on the next 'apply'.  This is as expected for jobs which run continuously, but may surprise users who use this resource for other kinds of Dataflow jobs.
 
-A Dataflow job which is 'destroyed' may be "cancelled" or "drained".  If "cancelled", the job terminates - any data written remains where it is, but no new data will be processed.  If "drained", no new data will enter the pipeline, but any data currently in the pipeline will finish being processed.  The default is "drain". When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `terraform destroy` to complete.

When `on_delete` is set to `"drain"` in the configuration, you may experience a long wait for your `pulumi destroy` to complete.
 
 You can potentially short-circuit the wait by setting `skip_wait_on_job_termination` to `true`, but beware that unless you take active steps to ensure that the job `name` parameter changes between instances, the name will conflict and the launch of the new job will fail.

+
+# google\_folder\_iam\_binding
+
+Allows creation and management of a single binding within IAM policy for
+an existing Google Cloud Platform folder.
+
+~> **Note:** This resource _must not_ be used in conjunction with
+   `google_folder_iam_policy` or they will fight over what your policy
+   should be.
+
+~> **Note:** On create, this resource will overwrite members of any existing roles.
+    Use `pulumi import` and inspect the output to ensure
+    your existing members are preserved.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+resource "google_folder" "department1" {
+  display_name = "Department 1"
+  parent       = "organizations/1234567"
+}
+
+resource "google_folder_iam_binding" "admin" {
+  folder = google_folder.department1.name
+  role   = "roles/editor"
+
+  members = [
+    "user:alice@gmail.com",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `folder` - (Required) The resource name of the folder the policy is attached to. Its format is folders/{folder_id}.
+
+* `members` (Required) - An array of identities that will be granted the privilege in the `role`.
+  Each entry can have one of the following values:
+  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that is associated with a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com.
+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
+  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
+  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
+  * For more details on format and restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/Policy#Binding
+
+* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
+    `google_folder_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
+    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
+exported:
+
+* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the folder's IAM policy.
+
+## Import
+
+IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role.  These bindings can be imported using the `folder` and role, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import google_folder_iam_binding.viewer "folder-name roles/viewer"
+```
+
+-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM binding with a custom role, make sure to use the
+ full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

+  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
