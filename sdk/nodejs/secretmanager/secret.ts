/**
 * A Secret is a logical secret whose value and versions can be accessed.
 *
 * To get more information about Secret, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.secrets)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Secret Config Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const secret_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.Secret("secret-basic", {
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "my-label",
 *     },
 *     replication: {
 *         userManaged: {
 *             replicas: [
 *                 {
 *                     location: "us-central1",
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     location: "us-east1",
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 *     secretId: "secret",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Secret can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:secretmanager/secret:Secret default projects/{{project}}/secrets/{{secret_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:secretmanager/secret:Secret default {{project}}/{{secret_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:secretmanager/secret:Secret default {{secret_id}}
 * ```
