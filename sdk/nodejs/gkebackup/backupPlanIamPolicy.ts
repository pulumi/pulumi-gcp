 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Backup for GKE BackupPlan. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the backupplan and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the backupplan are preserved.
 * * `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the backupplan are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the backupplan
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamBinding` and `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## gcp.gkebackup.BackupPlanIamPolicy
 *

 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{name}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{name}}
 *
 * * {{name}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Backup for GKE backupplan IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkebackup/backupPlanIamPolicy:BackupPlanIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkebackup/backupPlanIamPolicy:BackupPlanIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkebackup/backupPlanIamPolicy:BackupPlanIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
