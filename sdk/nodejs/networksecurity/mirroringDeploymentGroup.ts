/**
 * A deployment group aggregates many zonal mirroring backends (deployments)
 * into a single global mirroring service. Consumers can connect this service
 * using an endpoint group.
 *
 * To get more information about MirroringDeploymentGroup, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.mirroringDeploymentGroups)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Mirroring deployment group overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/deployment-groups-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Security Mirroring Deployment Group Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "example-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringDeploymentGroup("default", {
 *     mirroringDeploymentGroupId: "example-dg",
 *     location: "global",
 *     network: network.id,
 *     description: "some description",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * MirroringDeploymentGroup can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeploymentGroups/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, MirroringDeploymentGroup can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeploymentGroup:MirroringDeploymentGroup default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeploymentGroups/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeploymentGroup:MirroringDeploymentGroup default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeploymentGroup:MirroringDeploymentGroup default {{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_group_id}}
 * ```
