/**
 * An endpoint group association represents a link between a network and an
 * endpoint group in the organization.
 *
 * Creating an association creates the networking infrastructure linking the
 * network to the endpoint group, but does not enable mirroring by itself.
 * To enable mirroring, the user must also create a network firewall policy
 * containing mirroring rules and associate it with the network.
 *
 * To get more information about MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.mirroringEndpointGroupAssociations)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Mirroring endpoint group association overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/endpoint-groups-overview#mirroring-endpoint-group-association)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Security Mirroring Endpoint Group Association Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const producerNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("producer_network", {
 *     name: "example-prod-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const consumerNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("consumer_network", {
 *     name: "example-cons-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const deploymentGroup = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringDeploymentGroup("deployment_group", {
 *     mirroringDeploymentGroupId: "example-dg",
 *     location: "global",
 *     network: producerNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const endpointGroup = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringEndpointGroup("endpoint_group", {
 *     mirroringEndpointGroupId: "example-eg",
 *     location: "global",
 *     mirroringDeploymentGroup: deploymentGroup.id,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation("default", {
 *     mirroringEndpointGroupAssociationId: "example-ega",
 *     location: "global",
 *     network: consumerNetwork.id,
 *     mirroringEndpointGroup: endpointGroup.id,
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociations/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociation:MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociations/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociation:MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociation:MirroringEndpointGroupAssociation default {{location}}/{{mirroring_endpoint_group_association_id}}
 * ```
