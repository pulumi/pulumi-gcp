/**
 * A connectivity test is a static analysis of your resource configurations
 * that enables you to evaluate connectivity to and from Google Cloud
 * resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. This data source allows
 * you to list connectivity tests in a project.
 *
 * To get more information about connectivity tests, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center/docs/reference/networkmanagement/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.connectivityTests/rerun)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const tests = gcp.networkmanagement.getConnectivityTests({
 *     filter: "name:projects/project-id/locations/global/connectivityTests/my-tests",
