/**
 * A connectivity test are a static analysis of your resource configurations
 * that enables you to evaluate connectivity to and from Google Cloud
 * resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
 *
 * To get more information about ConnectivityTest, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center/docs/connectivity-tests/reference/networkmanagement/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.connectivityTests)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Network Management Connectivity Test Instances
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const vpc = new gcp.compute.Network("vpc", {});
 * const debian9 = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-9",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",
 * });
 * const source = new gcp.compute.Instance("source", {
 *     machineType: "e2-medium",
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: debian9.then(debian9 => debian9.id),
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: vpc.id,
 *         accessConfigs: [{}],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const destination = new gcp.compute.Instance("destination", {
 *     machineType: "e2-medium",
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: debian9.then(debian9 => debian9.id),
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: vpc.id,
 *         accessConfigs: [{}],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const instance_test = new gcp.networkmanagement.ConnectivityTest("instance-test", {
 *     source: {
 *         instance: source.id,
 *     },
 *     destination: {
 *         instance: destination.id,
 *     },
 *     protocol: "TCP",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Management Connectivity Test Addresses
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const vpc = new gcp.compute.Network("vpc", {});
 * const subnet = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("subnet", {
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/16",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: vpc.id,
 * });
 * const source_addr = new gcp.compute.Address("source-addr", {
 *     subnetwork: subnet.id,
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     address: "10.0.42.42",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * const dest_addr = new gcp.compute.Address("dest-addr", {
 *     subnetwork: subnet.id,
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     address: "10.0.43.43",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * const address_test = new gcp.networkmanagement.ConnectivityTest("address-test", {
 *     source: {
 *         ipAddress: source_addr.address,
 *         projectId: source_addr.project,
 *         network: vpc.id,
 *         networkType: "GCP_NETWORK",
 *     },
 *     destination: {
 *         ipAddress: dest_addr.address,
 *         projectId: dest_addr.project,
 *         network: vpc.id,
 *     },
 *     protocol: "UDP",
 * });
 * ```
 *
