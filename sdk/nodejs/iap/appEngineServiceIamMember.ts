/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Identity-Aware Proxy AppEngineService. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the appengineservice and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the appengineservice are preserved.
 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the appengineservice are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the appengineservice
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamBinding` and `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.iap.AppEngineServiceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * > **Note:**  This resource supports IAM Conditions but they have some known limitations which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview#limitations). Please review this article if you are having issues with IAM Conditions.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}} * {{project}}/{{appId}}/{{service}} * {{appId}}/{{service}} * {{service}} Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration. Identity-Aware Proxy appengineservice IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member. IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineServiceIamMember:AppEngineServiceIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineServiceIamMember:AppEngineServiceIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iap/appEngineServiceIamMember:AppEngineServiceIamMember editor projects/{{project}}/iap_web/appengine-{{appId}}/services/{{service}}
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
