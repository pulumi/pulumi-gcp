 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Identity-Aware Proxy WebCloudRunService. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the webcloudrunservice and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the webcloudrunservice are preserved.
 * * `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the webcloudrunservice are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the webcloudrunservice
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamBinding` and `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.iap.WebCloudRunServiceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/iap_web/cloud_run-{{location}}/services/{{name}}
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * * {{location}}/{{name}}
 * * {{name}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Identity-Aware Proxy webcloudrunservice IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 * ```sh
 * $ terraform import google_iap_web_cloud_run_service_iam_member.editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/cloud_run-{{location}}/services/{{web_cloud_run_service}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 * ```sh
 * $ terraform import google_iap_web_cloud_run_service_iam_binding.editor "projects/{{project}}/iap_web/cloud_run-{{location}}/services/{{web_cloud_run_service}} roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iap/webCloudRunServiceIamPolicy:WebCloudRunServiceIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/iap_web/cloud_run-{{location}}/services/{{web_cloud_run_service}}
 * ```
 *
 * > **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
