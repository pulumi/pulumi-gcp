 * An `ApiProduct` in Apigee.

 * To get more information about ApiProduct, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.apiproducts#ApiProduct)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating an API product](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/what-api-product)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Apigee Api Product Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const current = gcp.organizations.getClientConfig({});
 * const apigeeNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("apigee_network", {name: "apigee-network"});
 * const apigeeRange = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("apigee_range", {
 *     name: "apigee-range",
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 16,
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const apigeeVpcConnection = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("apigee_vpc_connection", {
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [apigeeRange.name],

 * ## Import
 *
 * ApiProduct can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{org_id}}/apiproducts/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{org_id}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ApiProduct can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:apigee/apiProduct:ApiProduct default {{org_id}}/apiproducts/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:apigee/apiProduct:ApiProduct default {{org_id}}/{{name}}
 * ```
