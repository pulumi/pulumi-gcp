/**
 * A Cloud Deploy `CustomTargetType` defines a type of custom target that can be referenced in a
 * Cloud Deploy `Target` in order to facilitate deploying to other systems besides the supported runtimes.
 *
 * To get more information about CustomTargetType, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.customTargetTypes)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Define and use a custom target type](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploy-app-custom-target)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Clouddeploy Custom Target Type Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const custom_target_type = new gcp.clouddeploy.CustomTargetType("custom-target-type", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "my-custom-target-type",
 *     description: "My custom target type",
 *     annotations: {
 *         my_first_annotation: "example-annotation-1",
 *         my_second_annotation: "example-annotation-2",
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         my_first_label: "example-label-1",
 *         my_second_label: "example-label-2",
 *     },
 *     customActions: {
 *         renderAction: "renderAction",
 *         deployAction: "deployAction",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Clouddeploy Custom Target Type Git Skaffold Modules
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const custom_target_type = new gcp.clouddeploy.CustomTargetType("custom-target-type", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "my-custom-target-type",
 *     description: "My custom target type",
 *     customActions: {
 *         renderAction: "renderAction",
 *         deployAction: "deployAction",
 *         includeSkaffoldModules: [{
 *             configs: ["my-config"],
 *             git: {
 *                 repo: "http://github.com/example/example-repo.git",
 *                 path: "configs/skaffold.yaml",
 *                 ref: "main",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Clouddeploy Custom Target Type Gcs Skaffold Modules
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const custom_target_type = new gcp.clouddeploy.CustomTargetType("custom-target-type", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "my-custom-target-type",
 *     description: "My custom target type",
 *     customActions: {
 *         renderAction: "renderAction",
 *         deployAction: "deployAction",
 *         includeSkaffoldModules: [{
 *             configs: ["my-config"],
 *             googleCloudStorage: {
 *                 source: "gs://example-bucket/dir/configs/*",
 *                 path: "skaffold.yaml",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Clouddeploy Custom Target Type Gcb Repo Skaffold Modules
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const custom_target_type = new gcp.clouddeploy.CustomTargetType("custom-target-type", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "my-custom-target-type",
 *     description: "My custom target type",
 *     customActions: {
 *         renderAction: "renderAction",
 *         deployAction: "deployAction",
 *         includeSkaffoldModules: [{
 *             configs: ["my-config"],
 *             googleCloudBuildRepo: {
 *                 repository: "projects/example/locations/us-central1/connections/git/repositories/example-repo",
 *                 path: "configs/skaffold.yaml",
 *                 ref: "main",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CustomTargetType can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/customTargetTypes/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, CustomTargetType can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/customTargetType:CustomTargetType default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/customTargetTypes/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/customTargetType:CustomTargetType default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/customTargetType:CustomTargetType default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
