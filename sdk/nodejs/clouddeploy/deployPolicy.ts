 * A `DeployPolicy` inhibits manual or DeployPolicy-driven actions within a Delivery Pipeline or Target.
 *
 * To get more information about DeployPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.deployPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Restrict deploy behavior using policies](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploy-policy)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Clouddeploy Deploy Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const b_deploy_policy = new gcp.clouddeploy.DeployPolicy("b-deploy-policy", {
 *     name: "cd-policy",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     selectors: [{
 *         deliveryPipeline: {
 *             id: "cd-pipeline",
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     rules: [{
 *         rolloutRestriction: {
 *             id: "rule",
 *             timeWindows: {
 *                 timeZone: "America/Los_Angeles",
 *                 weeklyWindows: [{
 *                     startTime: {
 *                         hours: 0,
 *                         minutes: 0,
 *                     },
 *                     endTime: {
 *                         hours: 24,
 *                         minutes: 0,
 *                     },
 *                 }],
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Clouddeploy Deploy Policy Full

 * ## Import
 *
 * DeployPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, DeployPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
