/**
 * Allows configuring a single access level condition to be appended to an access level's conditions.
 * This resource is intended to be used in cases where it is not possible to compile a full list
 * of conditions to include in a `gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessLevel` resource,
 * to enable them to be added separately.
 *
 * > **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessLevel` resource,
 * the access level resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignoreChanges = [basic[0].conditions]` so
 * they don't fight over which service accounts should be included.
 *
 * To get more information about AccessLevelCondition, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.accessLevels)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Access Policy Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/quickstart)
 *
 * > **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
 * you must specify a `billingProject` and set `userProjectOverride` to true
 * in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
 * Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
 * `billingProject` you defined.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Access Context Manager Access Level Condition Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const access_policy = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessPolicy("access-policy", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     title: "my policy",
 * });
 * const access_level_service_account = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessLevel("access-level-service-account", {
 *     parent: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${access_policy.name}`,
 *     name: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${access_policy.name}/accessLevels/chromeos_no_lock`,
 *     title: "chromeos_no_lock",
 *     basic: {
 *         conditions: [{
 *             devicePolicy: {
 *                 requireScreenLock: true,
 *                 osConstraints: [{
 *                     osType: "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS",
 *                 }],
 *             },
 *             regions: [
 *                 "CH",
 *                 "IT",
 *                 "US",
 *             ],
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * const created_later = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("created-later", {accountId: "my-account-id"});
 * const access_level_conditions = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessLevelCondition("access-level-conditions", {
 *     accessLevel: access_level_service_account.name,
 *     ipSubnetworks: ["192.0.4.0/24"],
 *     members: [
 *         "user:test@google.com",
 *         "user:test2@google.com",
 *         pulumi.interpolate`serviceAccount:${created_later.email}`,
 *     ],
 *     negate: false,
 *     devicePolicy: {
 *         requireScreenLock: false,
 *         requireAdminApproval: false,
 *         requireCorpOwned: true,
 *         osConstraints: [{
 *             osType: "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     regions: [
 *         "IT",
 *         "US",
