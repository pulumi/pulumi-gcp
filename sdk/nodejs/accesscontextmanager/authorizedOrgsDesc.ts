/**
 * An authorized organizations description describes a list of organizations
 * (1) that have been authorized to use certain asset (for example, device) data
 * owned by different organizations at the enforcement points, or (2) with certain
 * asset (for example, device) have been authorized to access the resources in
 * another organization at the enforcement points.
 *
 * To get more information about AuthorizedOrgsDesc, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.authorizedOrgsDescs)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [gcloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise/docs/cross-org-authorization)
 *
 * > **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
 * you must specify a `billingProject` and set `userProjectOverride` to true
 * in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
 * Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
 * `billingProject` you defined.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Access Context Manager Authorized Orgs Desc Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test_access = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessPolicy("test-access", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     title: "my policy",
 * });
 * const authorized_orgs_desc = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AuthorizedOrgsDesc("authorized-orgs-desc", {
 *     parent: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${test_access.name}`,
 *     name: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${test_access.name}/authorizedOrgsDescs/fakeDescName`,
 *     authorizationType: "AUTHORIZATION_TYPE_TRUST",
 *     assetType: "ASSET_TYPE_CREDENTIAL_STRENGTH",
 *     authorizationDirection: "AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_TO",
 *     orgs: [
 *         "organizations/12345",
 *         "organizations/98765",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * AuthorizedOrgsDesc can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, AuthorizedOrgsDesc can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:accesscontextmanager/authorizedOrgsDesc:AuthorizedOrgsDesc default {{name}}
 * ```
