/**
 * ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
 * and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
 * ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
 * has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
 * Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
 * - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
 * GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
 * Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
 * project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about ServicePerimeter, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.servicePerimeters)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Service Perimeter Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/quickstart)
 * 
 * ## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Service Perimeter Basic
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const servicePerimeter = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.ServicePerimeter("service-perimeter", {
 *     parent: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy_test_access.name}`,
 *     status: {
 *         restrictedServices: ["storage.googleapis.com"],
 *     },
 *     title: "restrictAll",
 * });
 * const accessLevel = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessLevel("access-level", {
 *     basic: {
 *         conditions: [{
 *             devicePolicy: {
 *                 osConstraints: [{
 *                     osType: "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS",
 *                 }],
 *                 requireScreenLock: false,
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     parent: pulumi.interpolate`accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy_test_access.name}`,
 *     title: "chromeosNoLock",
 * });
 * const accessPolicy = new gcp.accesscontextmanager.AccessPolicy("access-policy", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     title: "my policy",
 * });
 * ```
