/**
 * A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using
 * a configuration file
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
 * and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in the provider as well
 * will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
 * fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
 * experienced user of both tools.
 *
 * In addition, due to limitations of the API, the provider will treat
 * deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
 * than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
 * `preview=false`).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Deployment Manager Deployment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as std from "@pulumi/std";
 *
 * const deployment = new gcp.deploymentmanager.Deployment("deployment", {
 *     name: "my-deployment",
 *     target: {
 *         config: {
 *             content: std.file({
 *                 input: "path/to/config.yml",
 *             }).then(invoke => invoke.result),
 *         },
 *     },
 *     labels: [{
 *         key: "foo",
 *         value: "bar",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Import
 *
 * Deployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/deployments/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Deployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default projects/{{project}}/deployments/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default {{name}}
 * ```
