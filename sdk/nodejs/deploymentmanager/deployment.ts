/**
 * A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using

 * 
 * > **Warning:** This resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
 * and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in the provider as well
 * will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
 * fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
 * experienced user of both tools.
 * 
 * In addition, due to limitations of the API, the provider will treat
 * deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
 * than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
 * `preview=false`).
