/**
 * The enforcement configuration for a service supported by App Check.
 *
 * To get more information about ServiceConfig, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/appcheck/rest/v1/projects.services)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firebase App Check Service Config Off
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const appcheck = new gcp.projects.Service("appcheck", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.firebase.AppCheckServiceConfig("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     serviceId: "firestore.googleapis.com",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [appcheck],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firebase App Check Service Config Enforced
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const appcheck = new gcp.projects.Service("appcheck", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.firebase.AppCheckServiceConfig("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     serviceId: "firebasestorage.googleapis.com",
 *     enforcementMode: "ENFORCED",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [appcheck],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firebase App Check Service Config Unenforced
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const appcheck = new gcp.projects.Service("appcheck", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.firebase.AppCheckServiceConfig("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     serviceId: "identitytoolkit.googleapis.com",
 *     enforcementMode: "UNENFORCED",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [appcheck],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ServiceConfig can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/services/{{service_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{service_id}}`
 * * `{{service_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ServiceConfig can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appCheckServiceConfig:AppCheckServiceConfig default projects/{{project}}/services/{{service_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appCheckServiceConfig:AppCheckServiceConfig default {{project}}/{{service_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appCheckServiceConfig:AppCheckServiceConfig default {{service_id}}
 * ```

     * callers. While the service is protected by App Check, other applicable protections, such as user
     * authorization, continue to be enforced at the same time.
     * Use caution when choosing to enforce App Check on a Firebase service. If your users have not updated
     * to an App Check capable version of your app, their apps will no longer be able to use your Firebase
     * services that are enforcing App Check. App Check metrics can help you decide whether to enforce App
     * Check on your Firebase services.
     * If your app has not launched yet, you should enable enforcement immediately, since there are no outdated
     * clients in use.
