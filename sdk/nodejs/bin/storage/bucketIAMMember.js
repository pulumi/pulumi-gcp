/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for storage bucket. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the storage bucket are preserved.
 * * `google_storage_bucket_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the storage bucket are preserved.
 * * `google_storage_bucket_iam_policy`: Setting a policy removes all other permissions on the bucket, and if done incorrectly, there's a real chance you will lock yourself out of the bucket. If possible for your use case, using multiple google_storage_bucket_iam_binding resources will be much safer. See the usage example on how to work with policy correctly.
 *
 *
 * > **Note:** `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_storage_bucket_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## google\_storage\_bucket\_iam\_binding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const binding = new gcp.storage.BucketIAMBinding("binding", {
 *     bucket: "your-bucket-name",
 *     members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectViewer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_storage\_bucket\_iam\_member
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const member = new gcp.storage.BucketIAMMember("member", {
 *     bucket: "your-bucket-name",
 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectViewer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_storage\_bucket\_iam\_policy
 *
 * When applying a policy that does not include the roles listed below, you lose the default permissions which google adds to your bucket:
 * * `roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner`
 * * `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader`
 *
 * If this happens only an entity with `roles/storage.admin` privileges can repair this bucket's policies. It is recommended to include the above roles in policies to get the same behaviour as with the other two options.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foo_policy = pulumi.output(gcp.organizations.getIAMPolicy({
 *     bindings: [{
 *         members: ["group:yourgroup@example.com"],
 *         role: "roles/your-role",
 *     }],
 * }));
 * const member = new gcp.storage.BucketIAMPolicy("member", {
 *     bucket: "your-bucket-name",
 *     policyData: foo_policy.apply(foo_policy => foo_policy.policyData),
 * });
 * ```
