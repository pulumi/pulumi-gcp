/**
 * Generates an IAM policy document that may be referenced by and applied to
 * other Google Cloud Platform resources, such as the `google_project` resource.
 *
 *
 * This data source is used to define IAM policies to apply to other resources.
 * Currently, defining a policy through a datasource and referencing that policy
 * from another resource is the only way to apply an IAM policy to a resource.
 *
 * **Note:** Several restrictions apply when setting IAM policies through this API.
 * See the [setIamPolicy docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy)
 * for a list of these restrictions.
