/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a project. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `google_project_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the project and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `google_project_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the project are preserved.
 * * `google_project_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the project are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `google_project_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `google_project_iam_binding` and `google_project_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `google_project_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_project_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## google\_project\_iam\_policy
 *
 * > **Be careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your project
 *    using this resource. Deleting a `google_project_iam_policy` removes access
 *    from anyone without organization-level access to the project. Proceed with caution.
 *    It's not recommended to use `google_project_iam_policy` with your provider project
 *    to avoid locking yourself out, and it should generally only be used with projects
 *    fully managed by Terraform.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const admin = pulumi.output(gcp.organizations.getIAMPolicy({
 *     bindings: [{
 *         members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *         role: "roles/editor",
 *     }],
 * }));
 * const project = new gcp.projects.IAMPolicy("project", {
 *     policyData: admin.apply(admin => admin.policyData),
 *     project: "your-project-id",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_project\_iam\_binding
 *
 * > **Note:** If `role` is set to `roles/owner` and you don't specify a user or service account you have access to in `members`, you can lock yourself out of your project.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = new gcp.projects.IAMBinding("project", {
 *     members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     project: "your-project-id",
 *     role: "roles/editor",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_project\_iam\_member
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = new gcp.projects.IAMMember("project", {
 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 *     project: "your-project-id",
 *     role: "roles/editor",
 * });
 * ```
