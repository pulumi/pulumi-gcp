/**
 * Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of configurations and revision templates which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership.
 *
 * To get more information about Service, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.services)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Cloudrunv2 Service Basic

 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.cloudrunv2.Service("default", {
 *     ingress: "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     template: {
