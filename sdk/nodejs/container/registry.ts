/**
 * > **Warning**: Container Registry is deprecated. Effective March 18, 2025, Container Registry is shut down and writing images to Container Registry is unavailable. Resource will be removed in future major release.
 *
 * Ensures that the Google Cloud Storage bucket that backs Google Container Registry exists. Creating this resource will create the backing bucket if it does not exist, or do nothing if the bucket already exists. Destroying this resource does *NOT* destroy the backing bucket. For more information see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/overview)
 *
 * This resource can be used to ensure that the GCS bucket exists prior to assigning permissions. For more information see the [access control page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control) for GCR.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const registry = new gcp.container.Registry("registry", {
 *     project: "my-project",
 *     location: "EU",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The `id` field of the `gcp.container.Registry` is the identifier of the storage bucket that backs GCR and can be used to assign permissions to the bucket.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const registry = new gcp.container.Registry("registry", {
 *     project: "my-project",
 *     location: "EU",
 * });
 * const viewer = new gcp.storage.BucketIAMMember("viewer", {
 *     bucket: registry.id,
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectViewer",
 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource does not support import.
