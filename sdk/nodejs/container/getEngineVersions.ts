/**
 * Provides access to available Google Kubernetes Engine versions in a zone or region for a given project.
 *
 * > If you are using the `gcp.container.getEngineVersions` datasource with a
 * regional cluster, ensure that you have provided a region as the `location` to
 * the datasource. A region can have a different set of supported versions than
 * its component zones, and not all zones in a region are guaranteed to
 * support the same version.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const central1b = gcp.container.getEngineVersions({
 *     location: "us-central1-b",
 *     versionPrefix: "1.12.",
 * });
 * const foo = new gcp.container.Cluster("foo", {
 *     location: "us-central1-b",
 *     nodeVersion: central1b.then(central1b => central1b.latestNodeVersion),
 *     initialNodeCount: 1,
 *     master_auth: {
 *         username: "mr.yoda",
 *         password: "adoy.rm",
 *     },
 * });
 * export const stableChannelVersion = central1b.then(central1b => central1b.releaseChannelDefaultVersion.STABLE);
 * ```
