 * A Parallelstore Instance.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Parallelstore Instance Basic Beta
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: true,
 *     mtu: 8896,
 * });
 * // Create an IP address
 * const privateIpAlloc = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("private_ip_alloc", {
 *     name: "address",
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 24,
 *     network: network.id,
 * });
 * // Create a private connection
 * const _default = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("default", {
 *     network: network.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [privateIpAlloc.name],
 * });
 * const instance = new gcp.parallelstore.Instance("instance", {
 *     instanceId: "instance",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     description: "test instance",
 *     capacityGib: "12000",
 *     network: network.name,
 *     fileStripeLevel: "FILE_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN",
 *     directoryStripeLevel: "DIRECTORY_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN",
 *     deploymentType: "SCRATCH",
 *     labels: {
 *         test: "value",

 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * ```

     * * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
     * the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`.
     * * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
     * to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
     * * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.
     * See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
     * If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
     * characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use
     * an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
     * specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
     * as the string:  `name + "_" + value` would prove problematic if we were to
     * allow `"_"` in a future release. "

     * **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
     * Please refer to the field `effectiveLabels` for all of the labels present on the resource.
