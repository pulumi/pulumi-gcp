/**
 * An owner is an additional user that may manage a verified web site in the
 * [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/). There
 * are two types of web resource owners:
 *
 * * Verified owners, which are added to a web resource automatically when it
 *     is created (i.e., when the resource is verified). A verified owner is
 *     determined by the identity of the user requesting verification.
 * * Additional owners, which can be added to the resource by verified owners.
 *
 * `gcp.siteverification.Owner` creates additional owners. If your web site
 * was verified using the
 * `gcp.siteverification.WebResource`
 * resource then you (or the identity was used to create the resource, such as a
 * service account) are already an owner.
 *
 * > **Note:** The email address of the owner must belong to a Google account,
 * such as a Gmail account, a Google Workspace account, or a GCP service account.
 *
 * Working with site verification requires the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/siteverification`
 * authentication scope. See the
 * Google Provider authentication documentation
 * to learn how to configure additional scopes.
 *
 * To get more information about site owners, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1/getting_started)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Site Verification Storage Bucket
 *
 * This example uses the `FILE` verification method to verify ownership of web site hosted
 * in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Ownership is proved by creating a file with a Google-provided
 * value in a known location. The user applying this configuration will automatically be
 * added as a verified owner, and the `gcp.siteverification.Owner` resource will add
 * `user@example.com` as an additional owner.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket", {
 *     name: "example-storage-bucket",
 *     location: "US",
 * });
 * const token = gcp.siteverification.getTokenOutput({
 *     type: "SITE",
 *     identifier: pulumi.interpolate`https://${bucket.name}.storage.googleapis.com/`,
 *     verificationMethod: "FILE",
 * });
 * const object = new gcp.storage.BucketObject("object", {
 *     name: token.apply(token => token.token),
 *     content: token.apply(token => `google-site-verification: ${token.token}`),
 *     bucket: bucket.name,
 * });
 * const publicRule = new gcp.storage.ObjectAccessControl("public_rule", {
 *     bucket: bucket.name,
 *     object: object.name,
 *     role: "READER",
 *     entity: "allUsers",
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.siteverification.WebResource("example", {
 *     site: {
 *         type: token.apply(token => token.type),
 *         identifier: token.apply(token => token.identifier),
 *     },
 *     verificationMethod: token.apply(token => token.verificationMethod),
 * });
 * const exampleOwner = new gcp.siteverification.Owner("example", {
 *     webResourceId: example.id,
 *     email: "user@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Owner can be imported using this format:
 *
 * * `webResource/{{web_resource_id}}/{{email}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Site owners can be imported using the format above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:siteverification/owner:Owner default webResource/{{web_resource_id}}/{{email}}
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note:** While verified owners can be successfully imported, attempting to later delete the imported resource will fail. The only way to remove
 * verified owners is to delete the web resource itself.
