/**
 * A gateway advertised route is a route that a gateway spoke advertises somewhere.
 *
 * To get more information about GatewayAdvertisedRoute, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.spokes.gatewayAdvertisedRoutes)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [QUICKSTART_TITLE](https://docs.cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/network-connectivity-center/concepts/ncc-gateway-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Connectivity Gateway Advertised Route Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "net-spoke",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const subnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("subnetwork", {
 *     name: "tf-test-subnet_6529",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/28",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: network.selfLink,
 * });
 * const basicHub = new gcp.networkconnectivity.Hub("basic_hub", {
 *     name: "hub",
 *     description: "A sample hub",
 *     labels: {
 *         "label-two": "value-one",
 *     },
 *     presetTopology: "HYBRID_INSPECTION",
 * });
 * const primary = new gcp.networkconnectivity.Spoke("primary", {
 *     name: "spoke-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     description: "A sample spoke of type Gateway",
 *     labels: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 *     hub: basicHub.id,
 *     gateway: {
 *         ipRangeReservations: [{
 *             ipRange: "10.0.0.0/23",
 *         }],
 *         capacity: "CAPACITY_1_GBPS",
 *     },
 *     group: "gateways",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkconnectivity.GatewayAdvertisedRoute("default", {
 *     spoke: primary.name,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "gateway-advertised-route-name",
 *     labels: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 *     description: "description of the gateway advertised route",
 *     ipRange: "0.0.0.0/24",
 *     recipient: "ADVERTISE_TO_HUB",
 *     priority: 200,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GatewayAdvertisedRoute can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/spokes/{{spoke}}/gatewayAdvertisedRoutes/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{spoke}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{spoke}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, GatewayAdvertisedRoute can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/gatewayAdvertisedRoute:GatewayAdvertisedRoute default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/spokes/{{spoke}}/gatewayAdvertisedRoutes/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/gatewayAdvertisedRoute:GatewayAdvertisedRoute default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{spoke}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkconnectivity/gatewayAdvertisedRoute:GatewayAdvertisedRoute default {{location}}/{{spoke}}/{{name}}
 * ```
