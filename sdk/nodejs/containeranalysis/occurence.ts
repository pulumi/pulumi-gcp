/**
 * An occurrence is an instance of a Note, or type of analysis that
 * can be done for a resource.
 *
 * To get more information about Occurrence, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/api/reference/rest/)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Container Analysis Occurrence Kms
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as std from "@pulumi/std";
 *
 * const note = new gcp.containeranalysis.Note("note", {
 *     name: "attestation-note",
 *     attestationAuthority: {
 *         hint: {
 *             humanReadableName: "Attestor Note",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const keyring = gcp.kms.getKMSKeyRing({
 *     name: "my-key-ring",
 *     location: "global",
 * });
 * const crypto_key = keyring.then(keyring => gcp.kms.getKMSCryptoKey({
 *     name: "my-key",
 *     keyRing: keyring.id,
 * }));
 * const version = crypto_key.then(crypto_key => gcp.kms.getKMSCryptoKeyVersion({
 *     cryptoKey: crypto_key.id,
 * }));
 * const attestor = new gcp.binaryauthorization.Attestor("attestor", {
 *     name: "attestor",
 *     attestationAuthorityNote: {
 *         noteReference: note.name,
 *         publicKeys: [{
 *             id: version.then(version => version.id),
 *             pkixPublicKey: {
 *                 publicKeyPem: version.then(version => version.publicKeys?.[0]?.pem),
 *                 signatureAlgorithm: version.then(version => version.publicKeys?.[0]?.algorithm),
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * const occurrence = new gcp.containeranalysis.Occurence("occurrence", {
 *     resourceUri: "gcr.io/my-project/my-image",
 *     noteName: note.id,
 *     attestation: {
 *         serializedPayload: std.filebase64({
 *             input: "path/to/my/payload.json",
 *         }).then(invoke => invoke.result),
 *         signatures: [{
 *             publicKeyId: version.then(version => version.id),
 *             serializedPayload: std.filebase64({
 *                 input: "path/to/my/payload.json.sig",
 *             }).then(invoke => invoke.result),
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Occurrence can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/occurrences/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Occurrence can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default projects/{{project}}/occurrences/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default {{name}}
 * ```
