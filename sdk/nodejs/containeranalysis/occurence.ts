/**
 * An occurrence is an instance of a Note, or type of analysis that
 * can be done for a resource.
 *
 * To get more information about Occurrence, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/api/reference/rest/)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Occurrence can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/occurrences/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Occurrence can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default projects/{{project}}/occurrences/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:containeranalysis/occurence:Occurence default {{name}}
 * ```
