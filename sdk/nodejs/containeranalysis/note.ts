/**
 * A Container Analysis note is a high-level piece of metadata that
 * describes a type of analysis that can be done for a resource.
 *
 *
 * To get more information about Note, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/api/reference/rest/)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/)
 *     * [Creating Attestations (Occurrences)](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/making-attestations)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Container Analysis Note Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const note = new gcp.containeranalysis.Note("note", {
 *     attestationAuthority: {
 *         hint: {
 *             humanReadableName: "Attestor Note",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Container Analysis Note Attestation Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const note = new gcp.containeranalysis.Note("note", {
 *     attestationAuthority: {
 *         hint: {
 *             humanReadableName: "Attestor Note",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     expirationTime: "2120-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z",
 *     longDescription: "a longer description of test note",
 *     relatedUrls: [
 *         {
 *             label: "foo",
 *             url: "some.url",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             url: "google.com",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     shortDescription: "test note",
 * });
 * ```
