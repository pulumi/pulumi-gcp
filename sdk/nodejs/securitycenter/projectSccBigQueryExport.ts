/**
 * A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) Big Query Export Config.
 * It represents exporting Security Command Center data, including assets, findings, and security marks
 * using gcloud scc bqexports
 * > **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
 * in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
 * Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.
 *
 * To get more information about ProjectSccBigQueryExport, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.bigQueryExports)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-analyze-findings-in-big-query)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ProjectSccBigQueryExport can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{big_query_export_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{big_query_export_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ProjectSccBigQueryExport can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/projectSccBigQueryExport:ProjectSccBigQueryExport default projects/{{project}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/projectSccBigQueryExport:ProjectSccBigQueryExport default {{project}}/{{big_query_export_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/projectSccBigQueryExport:ProjectSccBigQueryExport default {{big_query_export_id}}
 * ```
