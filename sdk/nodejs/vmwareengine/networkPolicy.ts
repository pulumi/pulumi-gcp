/**
 * Represents a network policy resource. Network policies are regional resources.
 *
 * To get more information about NetworkPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.networkPolicies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Vmware Engine Network Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network_policy_nw = new gcp.vmwareengine.Network("network-policy-nw", {
 *     name: "sample-network",
 *     location: "global",
 *     type: "STANDARD",
 *     description: "VMwareEngine standard network sample",
 * });
 * const vmw_engine_network_policy = new gcp.vmwareengine.NetworkPolicy("vmw-engine-network-policy", {
 *     location: "us-west1",
 *     name: "sample-network-policy",
 *     edgeServicesCidr: "192.168.30.0/26",
 *     vmwareEngineNetwork: network_policy_nw.id,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Vmware Engine Network Policy Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network_policy_nw = new gcp.vmwareengine.Network("network-policy-nw", {
 *     name: "sample-network",
 *     location: "global",
 *     type: "STANDARD",
 *     description: "VMwareEngine standard network sample",
 * });
 * const vmw_engine_network_policy = new gcp.vmwareengine.NetworkPolicy("vmw-engine-network-policy", {
 *     location: "us-west1",
 *     name: "sample-network-policy",
 *     edgeServicesCidr: "192.168.30.0/26",
 *     vmwareEngineNetwork: network_policy_nw.id,
 *     description: "Sample Network Policy",
 *     internetAccess: {
 *         enabled: true,
 *     },
 *     externalIp: {
 *         enabled: true,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NetworkPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, NetworkPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vmwareengine/networkPolicy:NetworkPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
