 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud AI Notebooks Runtime. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the runtime and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the runtime are preserved.
 * * `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the runtime are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the runtime
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamBinding` and `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamPolicy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const admin = gcp.organizations.getIAMPolicy({
 *     bindings: [{
 *         role: "roles/viewer",
 *         members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const policy = new gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamPolicy("policy", {
 *     project: runtime.project,
 *     location: runtime.location,
 *     runtimeName: runtime.name,
 *     policyData: admin.then(admin => admin.policyData),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamBinding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const binding = new gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamBinding("binding", {
 *     project: runtime.project,

 *     runtimeName: runtime.name,
 *     role: "roles/viewer",
 *     members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamMember
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const member = new gcp.notebooks.RuntimeIamMember("member", {

 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",

 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/runtimes/{{runtime_name}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{runtime_name}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{runtime_name}}
 *
 * * {{runtime_name}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Cloud AI Notebooks runtime IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/runtimeIamPolicy:RuntimeIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/runtimes/{{runtime_name}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/runtimeIamPolicy:RuntimeIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/runtimes/{{runtime_name}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/runtimeIamPolicy:RuntimeIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/runtimes/{{runtime_name}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
