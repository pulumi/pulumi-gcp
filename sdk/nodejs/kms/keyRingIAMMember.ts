/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for KMS key ring. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the key ring and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the key ring are preserved.
 * * `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the key ring are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMBinding` and `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.kms.KeyRingIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

 * ## Import
 *
 * ### Importing IAM policies
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the Cloud KMS key ring only. For example:
 *
 * * `{{project_id}}/{{location}}/{{key_ring_name}}`
 *
 * An `import` block (Terraform v1.5.0 and later) can be used to import IAM policies:
 *
 * tf
 *
 * import {
 *
 *   id = "{{project_id}}/{{location}}/{{key_ring_name}}"
 *
 *   to = google_kms_key_ring_iam_policy.default
 *
 * }
 *
 * The `pulumi import` command can also be used:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/keyRingIAMMember:KeyRingIAMMember default {{project_id}}/{{location}}/{{key_ring_name}}
 * ```
