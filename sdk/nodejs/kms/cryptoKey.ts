/**
 * A `CryptoKey` represents a logical key that can be used for cryptographic operations.
 *
 * > **Note:** CryptoKeys cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
 * Destroying a provider-managed CryptoKey will remove it from state
 * and delete all CryptoKeyVersions, rendering the key unusable, but *will
 * not delete the resource from the project.* When the provider destroys these keys,
 * any data previously encrypted with these keys will be irrecoverable.
 * For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you use Pulumi's [protect resource option](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/options/protect/).
 *
 * To get more information about CryptoKey, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating a key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys#create_a_key)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Kms Crypto Key Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const keyring = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyring", {
 *     name: "keyring-example",
 *     location: "global",
 * });
 * const example_key = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("example-key", {
 *     name: "crypto-key-example",
 *     keyRing: keyring.id,
 *     rotationPeriod: "7776000s",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Kms Crypto Key Asymmetric Sign
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const keyring = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyring", {
 *     name: "keyring-example",
 *     location: "global",
 * });
 * const example_asymmetric_sign_key = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("example-asymmetric-sign-key", {
 *     name: "crypto-key-example",
 *     keyRing: keyring.id,
 *     purpose: "ASYMMETRIC_SIGN",
 *     versionTemplate: {
 *         algorithm: "EC_SIGN_P384_SHA384",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CryptoKey can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{key_ring}}/cryptoKeys/{{name}}`
 * * `{{key_ring}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, CryptoKey can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/cryptoKey:CryptoKey default {{key_ring}}/cryptoKeys/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:kms/cryptoKey:CryptoKey default {{key_ring}}/{{name}}
 * ```
