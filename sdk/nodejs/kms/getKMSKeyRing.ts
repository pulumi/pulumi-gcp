/**
 * Provides access to Google Cloud Platform KMS KeyRing. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy#key_ring)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings).
 * 
 * A KeyRing is a grouping of CryptoKeys for organizational purposes. A KeyRing belongs to a Google Cloud Platform Project
 * and resides in a specific location.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const myKeyRing = pulumi.output(gcp.kms.getKMSKeyRing({
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "my-key-ring",
 * }));
 * ```
