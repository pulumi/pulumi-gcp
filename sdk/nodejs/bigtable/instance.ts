 * # gcp.bigtable.Instance
 *
 * Creates a Google Bigtable instance. For more information see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/admin/rest/v2/projects.instances.clusters)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Simple Instance
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const production_instance = new gcp.bigtable.Instance("production-instance", {
 *     clusters: [{
 *         clusterId: "tf-instance-cluster",
 *         numNodes: 1,
 *         storageType: "HDD",
 *     }],
 *     labels: {
 *         "my-label": "prod-label",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Replicated Instance
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const production_instance = new gcp.bigtable.Instance("production-instance", {
 *     clusters: [
 *         // A cluster with fixed number of nodes.
 *         {
 *             clusterId: "tf-instance-cluster1",
 *             numNodes: 1,
 *             storageType: "HDD",
 *             zone: "us-central1-c",
 *         },
 *         // a cluster with auto scaling.
 *         {
 *             autoscalingConfig: {
 *                 cpuTarget: 50,
 *                 maxNodes: 3,
 *                 minNodes: 1,
 *             },
 *             clusterId: "tf-instance-cluster2",
 *             storageType: "HDD",
 *             zone: "us-central1-b",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     labels: {
 *         "my-label": "prod-label",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Bigtable Instances can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{name}}
 * ```
