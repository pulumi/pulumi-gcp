/**
 * A named resource representing the stream of messages from a single,
 * specific topic, to be delivered to the subscribing application.
 *
 * To get more information about Subscription, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.subscriptions)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Managing Subscriptions](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#managing_subscriptions)
 *
 * > **Note:** You can retrieve the email of the Google Managed Pub/Sub Service Account used for forwarding
 * by using the `gcp.projects.ServiceIdentity` resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Pubsub Subscription Push
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleTopic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", {});
 * const exampleSubscription = new gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription", {
 *     topic: exampleTopic.name,
 *     ackDeadlineSeconds: 20,
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     pushConfig: {
 *         pushEndpoint: "https://example.com/push",
 *         attributes: {
 *             "x-goog-version": "v1",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Subscription Pull
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleTopic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", {});
 * const exampleSubscription = new gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription", {
 *     topic: exampleTopic.name,
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     messageRetentionDuration: "1200s",
 *     retainAckedMessages: true,
 *     ackDeadlineSeconds: 20,
 *     expirationPolicy: {
 *         ttl: "300000.5s",
 *     },
 *     retryPolicy: {
 *         minimumBackoff: "10s",
 *     },
 *     enableMessageOrdering: false,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Subscription Different Project
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleTopic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", {project: "topic-project"});
 * const exampleSubscription = new gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription", {
 *     project: "subscription-project",
 *     topic: exampleTopic.name,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Subscription Dead Letter
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleTopic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", {});
 * const exampleDeadLetter = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleDeadLetter", {});
 * const exampleSubscription = new gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription", {
 *     topic: exampleTopic.name,
 *     deadLetterPolicy: {
 *         deadLetterTopic: exampleDeadLetter.id,
 *         maxDeliveryAttempts: 10,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Subscription Push Bq
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleTopic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", {});
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});

 * });
 * const testDataset = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("testDataset", {datasetId: "example_dataset"});
 * const testTable = new gcp.bigquery.Table("testTable", {
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 *     tableId: "example_table",
 *     datasetId: testDataset.datasetId,
 *     schema: `[
 *   {
 *     "name": "data",
 *     "type": "STRING",
 *     "mode": "NULLABLE",
 *     "description": "The data"
 *   }
 * ]
 * `,
 * });
 * const exampleSubscription = new gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription", {
 *     topic: exampleTopic.name,
 *     bigqueryConfig: {
 *         table: pulumi.interpolate`${testTable.project}.${testTable.datasetId}.${testTable.tableId}`,

 *         viewer,
 *         editor,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Subscription can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/subscription:Subscription default projects/{{project}}/subscriptions/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
