 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for BeyondCorp SecurityGateway. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the securitygateway and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the securitygateway are preserved.
 * * `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the securitygateway are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the securitygateway
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamBinding` and `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGatewayIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * > **Note:**  This resource supports IAM Conditions but they have some known limitations which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview#limitations). Please review this article if you are having issues with IAM Conditions.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}
 *
 * * {{security_gateway_id}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * BeyondCorp securitygateway IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGatewayIamPolicy:SecurityGatewayIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}} roles/beyondcorp.securityGatewayUser user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGatewayIamPolicy:SecurityGatewayIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}} roles/beyondcorp.securityGatewayUser"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGatewayIamPolicy:SecurityGatewayIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
