 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Workstations WorkstationConfig. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the workstationconfig and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the workstationconfig are preserved.
 * * `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the workstationconfig are preserved.
 *
 * A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
 *
 * * `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the workstationconfig
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamBinding` and `gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfigIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}
 *
 * * {{workstation_config_id}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Cloud Workstations workstationconfig IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationConfigIamMember:WorkstationConfigIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationConfigIamMember:WorkstationConfigIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationConfigIamMember:WorkstationConfigIamMember editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
