/**
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}
 *
 * * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
 *
 * * {{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
 *
 * * {{workstation_id}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Cloud Workstations workstation IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationIamBinding:WorkstationIamBinding editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationIamBinding:WorkstationIamBinding editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstationIamBinding:WorkstationIamBinding editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
