/**
 * A single instance of a developer workstation with its own persistent storage.
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
 * See Provider Versions for more details on beta resources.
 *
 * To get more information about Workstation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.workstationClusters.workstationConfigs.workstations)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Workstation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {
 *     name: "workstation-cluster",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("default", {
 *     name: "workstation-cluster",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/24",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: _default.name,
 * });
 * const defaultWorkstationCluster = new gcp.workstations.WorkstationCluster("default", {
 *     workstationClusterId: "workstation-cluster",
 *     network: _default.id,
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.id,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "key",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultWorkstationConfig = new gcp.workstations.WorkstationConfig("default", {
 *     workstationConfigId: "workstation-config",
 *     workstationClusterId: defaultWorkstationCluster.workstationClusterId,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     host: {
 *         gceInstance: {
 *             machineType: "e2-standard-4",
 *             bootDiskSizeGb: 35,
 *             disablePublicIpAddresses: true,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultWorkstation = new gcp.workstations.Workstation("default", {
 *     workstationId: "work-station",
 *     workstationConfigId: defaultWorkstationConfig.workstationConfigId,
 *     workstationClusterId: defaultWorkstationCluster.workstationClusterId,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "key",
 *     },
 *     env: {
 *         name: "foo",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Workstation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Workstation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default {{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
 * ```
