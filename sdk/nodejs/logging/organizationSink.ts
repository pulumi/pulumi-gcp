/**
 * Manages a organization-level logging sink. For more information see:
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/organizations.sinks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Exporting Logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const log_bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("log-bucket", {});
 * const my_sink = new gcp.logging.OrganizationSink("my-sink", {
 *     description: "some explaination on what this is",
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     destination: pulumi.interpolate`storage.googleapis.com/${log_bucket.name}`,
 *     filter: "resource.type = gce_instance AND severity >= WARNING",
 * });
 * const log_writer = new gcp.projects.IAMMember("log-writer", {
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectCreator",
 *     member: my_sink.writerIdentity,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Organization-level logging sinks can be imported using this format
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:logging/organizationSink:OrganizationSink my_sink organizations/{{organization_id}}/sinks/{{sink_id}}
 * ```
