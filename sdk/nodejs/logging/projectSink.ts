/**
 * Manages a project-level logging sink. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/),
 * [Exporting Logs in the API](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/).
 *
 * > **Note:** You must have [granted the "Logs Configuration Writer"](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control) IAM role (`roles/logging.configWriter`) to the credentials used with this provider.
 *
 * > **Note** You must [enable the Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const mySink = new gcp.logging.ProjectSink("my-sink", {
 *     // Can export to pubsub, cloud storage, or bigquery
 *     destination: "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/topics/instance-activity",
 *     // Log all WARN or higher severity messages relating to instances
 *     filter: "resource.type = gceInstance AND severity >= WARN",
 *     // Use a unique writer (creates a unique service account used for writing)
 *     uniqueWriterIdentity: true,
 * });
 * ```
