/**
 * Manages a project-level logging sink. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/),
 * [Exporting Logs in the API](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/).
 *
 * > **Note:** You must have [granted the "Logs Configuration Writer"](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control) IAM role (`roles/logging.configWriter`) to the credentials used with this provider.
 *
 * > **Note** You must [enable the Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const my_sink = new gcp.logging.ProjectSink("my-sink", {
 *     // Can export to pubsub, cloud storage, or bigquery
 *     destination: "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/topics/instance-activity",
 *     // Log all WARN or higher severity messages relating to instances
 *     filter: "resource.type = gce_instance AND severity >= WARN",
 *     // Use a unique writer (creates a unique service account used for writing)
 *     uniqueWriterIdentity: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A more complete example follows: this creates a compute instance, as well as a log sink that logs all activity to a
 * cloud storage bucket. Because we are using `uniqueWriterIdentity`, we must grant it access to the bucket. Note that
 * this grant requires the "Project IAM Admin" IAM role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`) granted to the credentials
 * used with this provider.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Our logged compute instance
 * const my_logged_instance = new gcp.compute.Instance("my-logged-instance", {
 *     machineType: "n1-standard-1",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     boot_disk: {
 *         initialize_params: {
 *             image: "debian-cloud/debian-9",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     network_interface: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *         access_config: [{}],
 *     }],
 * });
 * // A bucket to store logs in
 * const log_bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("log-bucket", {});
 * // Our sink; this logs all activity related to our "my-logged-instance" instance
 * const instance_sink = new gcp.logging.ProjectSink("instance-sink", {
 *     destination: pulumi.interpolate`storage.googleapis.com/${log_bucket.name}`,
 *     filter: pulumi.interpolate`resource.type = gce_instance AND resource.labels.instance_id = "${my_logged_instance.instanceId}"`,
 *     uniqueWriterIdentity: true,
 * });
 * // Because our sink uses a unique_writer, we must grant that writer access to the bucket.
 * const log_writer = new gcp.projects.IAMBinding("log-writer", {
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectCreator",
 *     members: [instance_sink.writerIdentity],
 * });
 * ```
