/**
 * Logs-based metric can also be used to extract values from logs and create a a distribution
 * of the values. The distribution records the statistics of the extracted values along with
 * an optional histogram of the values as specified by the bucket options.
 *
 * To get more information about Metric, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.metrics/create)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/apis)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Logging Metric Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const loggingMetric = new gcp.logging.Metric("logging_metric", {
 *     name: "my-(custom)/metric",
 *     filter: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR",
 *     metricDescriptor: {
 *         metricKind: "DELTA",
 *         valueType: "DISTRIBUTION",
 *         unit: "1",
 *         labels: [
 *             {
 *                 key: "mass",
 *                 valueType: "STRING",
 *                 description: "amount of matter",
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 key: "sku",
 *                 valueType: "INT64",
 *                 description: "Identifying number for item",
 *             },
 *         ],
 *         displayName: "My metric",
 *     },
 *     valueExtractor: "EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request)",
 *     labelExtractors: {
 *         mass: "EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request)",
 *         sku: "EXTRACT(jsonPayload.id)",
 *     },
 *     bucketOptions: {
 *         linearBuckets: {
 *             numFiniteBuckets: 3,
 *             width: 1,
 *             offset: 1,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Logging Metric Counter Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const loggingMetric = new gcp.logging.Metric("logging_metric", {
 *     name: "my-(custom)/metric",
 *     filter: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR",
 *     metricDescriptor: {
 *         metricKind: "DELTA",
 *         valueType: "INT64",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Logging Metric Counter Labels
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const loggingMetric = new gcp.logging.Metric("logging_metric", {
 *     name: "my-(custom)/metric",
 *     filter: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR",
 *     metricDescriptor: {
 *         metricKind: "DELTA",
 *         valueType: "INT64",
 *         labels: [{
 *             key: "mass",
 *             valueType: "STRING",
 *             description: "amount of matter",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     labelExtractors: {
 *         mass: "EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request)",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Logging Metric Logging Bucket
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const loggingMetric = new gcp.logging.ProjectBucketConfig("logging_metric", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     bucketId: "_Default",
 * });
 * const loggingMetricMetric = new gcp.logging.Metric("logging_metric", {
 *     name: "my-(custom)/metric",
 *     filter: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR",
 *     bucketName: loggingMetric.name,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Logging Metric Disabled
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const loggingMetric = new gcp.logging.Metric("logging_metric", {
 *     name: "my-(custom)/metric",
 *     filter: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR",
 *     metricDescriptor: {
 *         metricKind: "DELTA",
 *         valueType: "INT64",
 *     },
 *     disabled: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Metric can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{project}} {{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Metric can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:logging/metric:Metric default "{{project}} {{name}}"
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:logging/metric:Metric default {{name}}
 * ```
