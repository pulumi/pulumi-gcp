 * Describes the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) settings associated with a project.

 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Logging Project Cmek Settings Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const cmekSettings = pulumi.output(gcp.logging.getProjectCmekSettings({
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * }));
 * ```
