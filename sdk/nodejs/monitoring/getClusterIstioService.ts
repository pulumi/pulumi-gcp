/**
 * A Monitoring Service is the root resource under which operational aspects of a
 * generic service are accessible. A service is some discrete, autonomous, and
 * network-accessible unit, designed to solve an individual concern
 *
 * An Cluster Istio monitoring service is automatically created by GCP to monitor
 * Cluster Istio services.
 *
 * To get more information about Service, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Service Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring)
 *     * [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Monitoring Cluster Istio Service
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Monitors the default ClusterIstio service
 * const defaultClusterIstioService = pulumi.output(gcp.monitoring.getClusterIstioService({
 *     clusterName: "west",
 *     location: "us-west2-a",
 *     serviceName: "istio-policy",
 *     serviceNamespace: "istio-system",
 * }));
 * ```
