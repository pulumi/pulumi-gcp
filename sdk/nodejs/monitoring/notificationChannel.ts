/**
 * A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
 * when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
 * and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
 * like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.
 *
 * Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
 * and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
 * present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
 * present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
 * Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
 * and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
 * labels are required.
 *
 * A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
 * accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
 * This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
 *
 * To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Notification Options](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options)
 *     * [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Notification Channel Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const basic = new gcp.monitoring.NotificationChannel("basic", {
 *     displayName: "Test Notification Channel",
 *     labels: {
 *         email_address: "fake_email@blahblah.com",
 *     },
 *     type: "email",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Notification Channel Sensitive
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultNotificationChannel = new gcp.monitoring.NotificationChannel("default", {
 *     displayName: "Test Slack Channel",
 *     labels: {
 *         channel_name: "#foobar",
 *     },
 *     sensitiveLabels: {
 *         authToken: "one",
 *     },
 *     type: "slack",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/notificationChannel:NotificationChannel default {{name}}
 * ```
