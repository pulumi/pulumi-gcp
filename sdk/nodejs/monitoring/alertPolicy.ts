/**
 * A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is
 * considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people or services
 * about this state.
 *
 * To get more information about AlertPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     combiner: "OR",
 *     conditions: [{
 *         conditionThreshold: {
 *             aggregations: [{
 *                 alignmentPeriod: "60s",
 *                 perSeriesAligner: "ALIGN_RATE",
 *             }],
 *             comparison: "COMPARISON_GT",
 *             duration: "60s",
 *             filter: "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/write_bytes_count\" AND resource.type=\"gce_instance\"",
 *         },
 *         displayName: "test condition",
 *     }],
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",
 *     userLabels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * AlertPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/alertPolicy:AlertPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
