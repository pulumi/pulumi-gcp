/**
 * A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is
 * considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people or services
 * about this state.
 *
 * To get more information about AlertPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",
 *     combiner: "OR",
 *     conditions: [{
 *         displayName: "test condition",
 *         conditionThreshold: {
 *             filter: "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/write_bytes_count\" AND resource.type=\"gce_instance\"",
 *             duration: "60s",
 *             comparison: "COMPARISON_GT",
 *             aggregations: [{
 *                 alignmentPeriod: "60s",
 *                 perSeriesAligner: "ALIGN_RATE",
 *             }],
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     userLabels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Evaluation Missing Data
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",
 *     combiner: "OR",
 *     conditions: [{
 *         displayName: "test condition",
 *         conditionThreshold: {
 *             filter: "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/write_bytes_count\" AND resource.type=\"gce_instance\"",
 *             duration: "60s",
 *             comparison: "COMPARISON_GT",
 *             aggregations: [{
 *                 alignmentPeriod: "60s",
 *                 perSeriesAligner: "ALIGN_RATE",
 *             }],
 *             evaluationMissingData: "EVALUATION_MISSING_DATA_INACTIVE",
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     userLabels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Forecast Options
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",
 *     combiner: "OR",
 *     conditions: [{
 *         displayName: "test condition",
 *         conditionThreshold: {
 *             filter: "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/write_bytes_count\" AND resource.type=\"gce_instance\"",
 *             duration: "60s",
 *             forecastOptions: {
 *                 forecastHorizon: "3600s",
 *             },
 *             comparison: "COMPARISON_GT",
 *             aggregations: [{
 *                 alignmentPeriod: "60s",
 *                 perSeriesAligner: "ALIGN_RATE",
 *             }],
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     userLabels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Promql Condition
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",

 *     conditions: [{
 *         displayName: "test condition",
 *         conditionPrometheusQueryLanguage: {
 *             query: "compute_googleapis_com:instance_cpu_usage_time > 0",
 *             duration: "60s",

 *     }],
 *     alertStrategy: {
 *         autoClose: "1800s",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Monitoring Alert Policy Sql Condition
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const alertPolicy = new gcp.monitoring.AlertPolicy("alert_policy", {
 *     displayName: "My Alert Policy",

 *     conditions: [{
 *         displayName: "minutes row count",
 *         conditionSql: {
 *             query: "SELECT severity, resource FROM my_project.global._Default._AllLogs WHERE severity IS NOT NULL",
 *             minutes: {
 *                 periodicity: 600,
 *             },
 *             rowCountTest: {
 *                 comparison: "COMPARISON_GT",
 *                 threshold: 0,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * AlertPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/alertPolicies/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, AlertPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/alertPolicy:AlertPolicy default projects/{{project}}/alertPolicies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/alertPolicy:AlertPolicy default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/alertPolicy:AlertPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
