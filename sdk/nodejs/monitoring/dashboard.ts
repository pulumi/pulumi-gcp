/**
 * A Google Stackdriver dashboard. Dashboards define the content and layout of pages in the Stackdriver web application.
 *
 * To get more information about Dashboards, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v1/projects.dashboards)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Monitoring Dashboard Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const dashboard = new gcp.monitoring.Dashboard("dashboard", {dashboardJson: `{
 *   \\"displayName\\": \\"Demo Dashboard\\",
 *   \\"gridLayout\\": {
 *     \\"widgets\\": [
 *       {
 *         \\"blank\\": {}
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * `});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Monitoring Dashboard GridLayout
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const dashboard = new gcp.monitoring.Dashboard("dashboard", {dashboardJson: `{
 *   \\"displayName\\": \\"Grid Layout Example\\",

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Dashboard can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/dashboards/{{dashboard_id}}`
 * * `{{dashboard_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Dashboard can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/dashboard:Dashboard default projects/{{project}}/dashboards/{{dashboard_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/dashboard:Dashboard default {{dashboard_id}}
 * ```
