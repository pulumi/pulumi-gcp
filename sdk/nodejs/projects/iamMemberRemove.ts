/**
 * Ensures that a member:role pairing does not exist in a project's IAM policy.
 *
 * On create, this resource will modify the policy to remove the `member` from the
 * `role`. If the membership is ever re-added, the next refresh will clear this
 * resource from state, proposing re-adding it to correct the membership. Import is
 * not supported- this resource will acquire the current policy and modify it as
 * part of creating the resource.
 *
 * This resource will conflict with `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` and
 * `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resources that share a role, as well as
 * `gcp.projects.IAMMember` resources that target the same membership. When
 * multiple resources conflict the final state is not guaranteed to include or omit
 * the membership. Subsequent `pulumi up` calls will always show a diff
 * until the configuration is corrected.
 *
 * For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access)
 * and
 * [API reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const targetProject = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const foo = new gcp.projects.IamMemberRemove("foo", {
 *     role: "roles/editor",
 *     project: targetProjectGoogleProject.projectId,
 *     member: `serviceAccount:${targetProjectGoogleProject.number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`,
 * });
 * ```
