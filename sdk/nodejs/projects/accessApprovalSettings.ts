/**
 * Access Approval enables you to require your explicit approval whenever Google support and engineering need to access your customer content.
 *
 * To get more information about ProjectSettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Project Access Approval Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const projectAccessApproval = new gcp.projects.AccessApprovalSettings("project_access_approval", {
 *     enrolledServices: [{
 *         cloudProduct: "all",
 *         enrollmentLevel: "BLOCK_ALL",
 *     }],
 *     notificationEmails: [
 *         "testuser@example.com",
 *         "example.user@example.com",
 *     ],
 *     projectId: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Project Access Approval Active Key Version
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const keyRing = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyRing", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * const cryptoKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("cryptoKey", {
 *     keyRing: keyRing.id,
 *     purpose: "ASYMMETRIC_SIGN",
 *     versionTemplate: {
 *         algorithm: "EC_SIGN_P384_SHA384",
 *     },
 * });
 * const serviceAccount = gcp.accessapproval.getProjectServiceAccount({
 *     projectId: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * const iam = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMMember("iam", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: cryptoKey.id,
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier",
 *     member: serviceAccount.then(serviceAccount => `serviceAccount:${serviceAccount.accountEmail}`),
 * });
 * const cryptoKeyVersion = gcp.kms.getKMSCryptoKeyVersionOutput({
 *     cryptoKey: cryptoKey.id,
 * });
 * const projectAccessApproval = new gcp.projects.AccessApprovalSettings("projectAccessApproval", {
 *     projectId: "my-project-name",
 *     activeKeyVersion: cryptoKeyVersion.apply(cryptoKeyVersion => cryptoKeyVersion.name),
 *     enrolledServices: [{
 *         cloudProduct: "all",
 *     }],
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [iam],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ProjectSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default projects/{{project_id}}/accessApprovalSettings
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default {{project_id}}
 * ```
