/**
 * Access Approval enables you to require your explicit approval whenever Google support and engineering need to access your customer content.
 *
 * To get more information about ProjectSettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Project Access Approval Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const projectAccessApproval = new gcp.projects.AccessApprovalSettings("project_access_approval", {
 *     enrolledServices: [{
 *         cloudProduct: "all",
 *         enrollmentLevel: "BLOCK_ALL",
 *     }],
 *     notificationEmails: [
 *         "testuser@example.com",
 *         "example.user@example.com",
 *     ],
 *     projectId: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ProjectSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default projects/{{project_id}}/accessApprovalSettings
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default {{project_id}}
 * ```
