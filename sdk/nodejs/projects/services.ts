/**
 * Allows management of enabled API services for an existing Google Cloud
 * Platform project. Services in an existing project that are not defined
 * in the config will be removed.
 * 
 * For a list of services available, visit the
 * [API library page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) or run `gcloud services list`.
 * 
 * > **Note:** This resource attempts to be the authoritative source on *all* enabled APIs, which often
 * 	leads to conflicts when certain actions enable other APIs. If you do not need to ensure that
 * 	*exclusively* a particular set of APIs are enabled, you should most likely use the
 * 	google_project_service resource, one resource per API.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const project = new gcp.projects.Services("project", {
 *     project: "your-project-id",
 *     services: [
 *         "iam.googleapis.com",
 *         "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
