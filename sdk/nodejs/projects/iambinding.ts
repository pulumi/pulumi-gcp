/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a project. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the project and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the project are preserved.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the project are preserved.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`, `gcp.projects.IAMMember`, or `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * > **Note:** It is not possible to grant the `roles/owner` role using any of these resources due to this being disallowed by the underlying `projects.setIamPolicy` API method. See the method [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy) for full details. It is, however, possible to remove all owners from the project by passing in an empty `members = []` list to the `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resource. This is useful for removing the owner role from a project upon creation, however, precautions should be taken to avoid inadvertently locking oneself out of a project such as by granting additional roles to alternate entities.
 *
 * ## google\_project\_iam\_policy
 *
 * > **Be careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your project
 *    using this resource. Deleting a `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` removes access
 *    from anyone without organization-level access to the project. Proceed with caution.
 *    It's not recommended to use `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` with your provider project
 *    to avoid locking yourself out, and it should generally only be used with projects
 *    fully managed by this provider. If you do use this resource, it is recommended to **import** the policy before
 *    applying the change.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.
 *
 * This member resource can be imported using the `project_id`, role, and member e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMBinding:IAMBinding my_project "your-project-id roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role.
 *
 * This binding resource can be imported using the `project_id` and role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMBinding:IAMBinding my_project "your-project-id roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question.
 *
 * This policy resource can be imported using the `project_id`.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMBinding:IAMBinding my_project your-project-id
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMBinding:IAMBinding my_project "your-project-id foo.googleapis.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
