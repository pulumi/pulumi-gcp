/**
 * Allows management of a single API service for an existing Google Cloud Platform project.
 *
 * For a list of services available, visit the
 * [API library page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) or run `gcloud services list --available`.
 *
 * Requires [Service Usage API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/serviceusage.googleapis.com).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = new gcp.projects.Service("project", {
 *     disableDependentServices: true,
 *     project: "your-project-id",
 *     service: "iam.googleapis.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Project services can be imported using the `project_id` and `service`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:projects/service:Service my_project your-project-id/iam.googleapis.com
 * ```
 *
 *  Note that unlike other resources that fail if they already exist, `terraform apply` can be successfully used to verify already enabled services. This means that when importing existing resources into Terraform, you can either import the `google_project_service` resources or treat them as new infrastructure and run `terraform apply` to add them to state.
