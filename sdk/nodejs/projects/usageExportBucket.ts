/**
 * Allows creation and management of a Google Cloud Platform project.
 * 
 * Projects created with this resource must be associated with an Organization.
 * See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
 * 
 * The service account used to run Terraform when creating a `google_project`
 * resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`. See the
 * [Access Control for Organizations Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org)
 * doc for more information.
 * 
 * Note that prior to 0.8.5, `google_project` functioned like a data source,
 * meaning any project referenced by it had to be created and managed outside
 * Terraform. As of 0.8.5, `google_project` functions like any other Terraform
 * resource, with Terraform creating and managing the project. To replicate the old
 * behavior, either:
 * 
 * * Use the project ID directly in whatever is referencing the project, using the
 *   [google_project_iam_policy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_project_iam.html)
 *   to replace the old `policy_data` property.
 * * Use the [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/usage.html) functionality
 *   to import your pre-existing project into Terraform, where it can be referenced and
 *   used just like always, keeping in mind that Terraform will attempt to undo any changes
 *   made outside Terraform.
 * 
 * > It's important to note that any project resources that were added to your Terraform config
 * prior to 0.8.5 will continue to function as they always have, and will not be managed by
 * Terraform. Only newly added projects are affected.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const google_project_my_project = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project", {
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     orgId: "1234567",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 * });
 * ```
 * To create a project under a specific folder
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const google_folder_department1 = new gcp.organizations.Folder("department1", {
 *     displayName: "Department 1",
 *     parent: "organizations/1234567",
 * });
 * const google_project_my_project_in_a_folder = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project-in-a-folder", {
 *     folderId: google_folder_department1.name,
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 * });
 * ```
 * To create a project with an App Engine app attached
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const google_project_my_app_engine_app = new gcp.organizations.Project("my-app-engine-app", {
 *     appEngines: [{
 *         locationId: "us-central",
 *     }],
 *     name: "App Engine Project",
 *     orgId: "1234567",
 *     projectId: "app-engine-project",
 * });
 * ```
