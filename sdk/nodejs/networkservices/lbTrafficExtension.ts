/**
 * LbTrafficExtension is a resource that lets the extension service modify the headers and payloads of both requests and responses without impacting the choice of backend services or any other security policies associated with the backend service.
 *
 * To get more information about LbTrafficExtension, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.lbTrafficExtensions)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Configure a traffic extension](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/configure-callout#configure_a_traffic_extension)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * LbTrafficExtension can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbTrafficExtensions/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, LbTrafficExtension can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbTrafficExtension:LbTrafficExtension default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbTrafficExtensions/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbTrafficExtension:LbTrafficExtension default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbTrafficExtension:LbTrafficExtension default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
