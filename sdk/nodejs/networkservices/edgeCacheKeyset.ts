/**
 * EdgeCacheKeyset represents a collection of public keys used for validating signed requests.
 *
 * To get more information about EdgeCacheKeyset, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.edgeCacheKeysets)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Create keysets](https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/create-keyset)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheKeyset("default", {
 *     name: "my-keyset",
 *     description: "The default keyset",
 *     publicKeys: [
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key",
 *             value: "FHsTyFHNmvNpw4o7-rp-M1yqMyBF8vXSBRkZtkQ0RKY",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key-2",
 *             value: "hzd03llxB1u5FOLKFkZ6_wCJqC7jtN0bg7xlBqS6WVM",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Dual Token
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const secret_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.Secret("secret-basic", {
 *     secretId: "secret-name",
 *     replication: {
 *         auto: {},
 *     },
 * });
 * const secret_version_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.SecretVersion("secret-version-basic", {
 *     secret: secret_basic.id,
 *     secretData: "secret-data",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheKeyset("default", {
 *     name: "my-keyset",
 *     description: "The default keyset",
 *     publicKeys: [{
 *         id: "my-public-key",
 *         managed: true,
 *     }],
 *     validationSharedKeys: [{
 *         secretVersion: secret_version_basic.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * EdgeCacheKeyset can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, EdgeCacheKeyset can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default {{name}}
 * ```
