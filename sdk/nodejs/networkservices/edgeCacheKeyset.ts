/**
 * EdgeCacheKeyset represents a collection of public keys used for validating signed requests.
 *
 * > **Warning:** All arguments including `public_key.public_key.value` will be stored in the raw
 * state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultEdgeCacheKeyset = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheKeyset("default", {
 *     description: "The default keyset",
 *     publicKeys: [
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key",
 *             value: "FHsTyFHNmvNpw4o7-rp-M1yqMyBF8vXSBRkZtkQ0RKY",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key-2",
 *             value: "hzd03llxB1u5FOLKFkZ6_wCJqC7jtN0bg7xlBqS6WVM",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * EdgeCacheKeyset can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheKeyset:EdgeCacheKeyset default {{name}}
