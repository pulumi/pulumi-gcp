/**
 * LbRouteExtension is a resource that lets you control where traffic is routed to for a given request.
 *
 * To get more information about LbRouteExtension, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.lbRouteExtensions)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Configure a route extension](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/configure-callout#configure_a_route_extension)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * LbRouteExtension can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbRouteExtensions/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, LbRouteExtension can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbRouteExtension:LbRouteExtension default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbRouteExtensions/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbRouteExtension:LbRouteExtension default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/lbRouteExtension:LbRouteExtension default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
