/**
 * EdgeCacheService defines the IP addresses, protocols, security policies, cache policies and routing configuration.
 *
 * > **Warning:** These resources require allow-listing to use, and are not openly available to all Cloud customers. Engage with your Cloud account team to discuss how to onboard.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * EdgeCacheService can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheService:EdgeCacheService default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheServices/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheService:EdgeCacheService default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheService:EdgeCacheService default {{name}}
