 * EdgeCacheService defines the IP addresses, protocols, security policies, cache policies and routing configuration.

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Service Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const dest = new gcp.storage.Bucket("dest", {
 *     location: "US",
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 * });
 * const instanceEdgeCacheOrigin = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheOrigin("instanceEdgeCacheOrigin", {
 *     originAddress: dest.url,
 *     description: "The default bucket for media edge test",
 *     maxAttempts: 2,
 *     timeout: {
 *         connectTimeout: "10s",
 *     },
 * });
 * const instanceEdgeCacheService = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheService("instanceEdgeCacheService", {
 *     description: "some description",
 *     routing: {
 *         hostRules: [{
 *             description: "host rule description",
 *             hosts: ["sslcert.tf-test.club"],
 *             pathMatcher: "routes",
