/**
 * EdgeCacheOrigin represents a HTTP-reachable backend for an EdgeCacheService.
 *
 * To get more information about EdgeCacheOrigin, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.edgeCacheOrigins)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Origin Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheOrigin("default", {
 *     name: "my-origin",
 *     originAddress: "gs://media-edge-default",
 *     description: "The default bucket for media edge test",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Origin Advanced
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const fallback = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheOrigin("fallback", {
 *     name: "my-fallback",
 *     originAddress: "fallback.example.com",
 *     description: "The default bucket for media edge test",
 *     maxAttempts: 3,
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     port: 80,
 *     retryConditions: [
 *         "CONNECT_FAILURE",
 *         "NOT_FOUND",
 *         "HTTP_5XX",
 *         "FORBIDDEN",

 *         ],
 *     },
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheOrigin("default", {
 *     name: "my-origin",
 *     originAddress: "gs://media-edge-default",
 *     failoverOrigin: fallback.id,
 *     description: "The default bucket for media edge test",
 *     maxAttempts: 2,
 *     labels: {
 *         a: "b",
 *     },
 *     timeout: {
 *         connectTimeout: "10s",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Origin V4auth
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const secret_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.Secret("secret-basic", {
 *     secretId: "secret-name",
 *     replication: {
 *         auto: {},
 *     },
 * });
 * const secret_version_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.SecretVersion("secret-version-basic", {
 *     secret: secret_basic.id,
 *     secretData: "secret-data",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheOrigin("default", {
 *     name: "my-origin",
 *     originAddress: "gs://media-edge-default",
 *     description: "The default bucket for V4 authentication",
 *     awsV4Authentication: {
 *         accessKeyId: "ACCESSKEYID",
 *         secretAccessKeyVersion: secret_version_basic.id,
 *         originRegion: "auto",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * EdgeCacheOrigin can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, EdgeCacheOrigin can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheOrigin:EdgeCacheOrigin default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheOrigin:EdgeCacheOrigin default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networkservices/edgeCacheOrigin:EdgeCacheOrigin default {{name}}
 * ```
