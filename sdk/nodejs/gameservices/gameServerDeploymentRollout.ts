 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Game Service Deployment Rollout Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultGameServerDeployment = new gcp.gameservices.GameServerDeployment("defaultGameServerDeployment", {
 *     deploymentId: "tf-test-deployment",
 *     description: "a deployment description",
 * });
 * const defaultGameServerConfig = new gcp.gameservices.GameServerConfig("defaultGameServerConfig", {
 *     configId: "tf-test-config",
 *     deploymentId: defaultGameServerDeployment.deploymentId,
 *     description: "a config description",
 *     fleetConfigs: [{
 *         name: "some-non-guid",
 *         fleetSpec: JSON.stringify({

 *     deploymentId: defaultGameServerDeployment.deploymentId,
 *     defaultGameServerConfig: defaultGameServerConfig.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GameServerDeploymentRollout can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:gameservices/gameServerDeploymentRollout:GameServerDeploymentRollout default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/gameServerDeployments/{{deployment_id}}/rollout
