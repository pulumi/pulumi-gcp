/**
 * Allows management of a Google Cloud service account.
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts)
 *
 * > **Warning:**  If you delete and recreate a service account, you must reapply any IAM roles that it had before.
 *
 * > Creation of service accounts is eventually consistent, and that can lead to
 * errors when you try to apply ACLs to service accounts immediately after
 * creation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * This snippet creates a service account in a project.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     accountId: "service-account-id",
 *     displayName: "Service Account",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Service accounts can be imported using their URI, e.g.
 *
 * * `projects/{{project_id}}/serviceAccounts/{{email}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, service accounts can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:serviceaccount/account:Account default projects/{{project_id}}/serviceAccounts/{{email}}
 * ```
