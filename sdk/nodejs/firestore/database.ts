 * A Cloud Firestore Database.
 *
 * If you wish to use Firestore with App Engine, use the
 * `gcp.appengine.Application`
 * resource instead.
 *
 * To get more information about Database, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/)

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Database can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:firestore/database:Database default projects/{{project}}/databases/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:firestore/database:Database default {{project}}/{{name}}
