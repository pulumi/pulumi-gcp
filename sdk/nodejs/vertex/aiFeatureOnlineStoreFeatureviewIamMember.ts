/**
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
 *
 * * {{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{name}}
 *
 * * {{feature_online_store}}/{{name}}
 *
 * * {{name}}
 *
 * Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
 *
 * Vertex AI featureonlinestorefeatureview IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember:AiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember editor "{{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{feature_online_store_featureview}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember:AiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember editor "{{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{feature_online_store_featureview}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 * IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember:AiFeatureOnlineStoreFeatureviewIamMember editor {{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{feature_online_store_featureview}}
 * ```
 *
 * -> **Custom Roles** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 *  full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
