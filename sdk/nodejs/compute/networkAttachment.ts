/**
 * A network attachment is a resource that lets a producer Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network initiate connections to a consumer VPC network through a Private Service Connect interface.
 *
 * To get more information about NetworkAttachment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networkAttachments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/about-network-attachments)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Attachment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {
 *     name: "basic-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("default", {
 *     name: "basic-subnetwork",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/16",
 * });
 * const rejectedProducerProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("rejected_producer_project", {
 *     projectId: "prj-rejected",
 *     name: "prj-rejected",
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     billingAccount: "000000-0000000-0000000-000000",
 *     deletionPolicy: "DELETE",
 * });
 * const acceptedProducerProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("accepted_producer_project", {
 *     projectId: "prj-accepted",
 *     name: "prj-accepted",
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     billingAccount: "000000-0000000-0000000-000000",
 *     deletionPolicy: "DELETE",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.NetworkAttachment("default", {
 *     name: "basic-network-attachment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     description: "basic network attachment description",
 *     connectionPreference: "ACCEPT_MANUAL",
 *     subnetworks: [defaultSubnetwork.selfLink],
 *     producerAcceptLists: [acceptedProducerProject.projectId],
 *     producerRejectLists: [rejectedProducerProject.projectId],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Attachment Instance Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {
 *     name: "basic-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("default", {
 *     name: "basic-subnetwork",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: _default.id,
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/16",
 * });
 * const defaultNetworkAttachment = new gcp.compute.NetworkAttachment("default", {
 *     name: "basic-network-attachment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     description: "my basic network attachment",
 *     subnetworks: [defaultSubnetwork.id],
 *     connectionPreference: "ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC",
 * });
 * const defaultInstance = new gcp.compute.Instance("default", {
 *     name: "basic-instance",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     machineType: "e2-micro",
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: "debian-cloud/debian-11",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkInterfaces: [
 *         {
 *             network: "default",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             networkAttachment: defaultNetworkAttachment.selfLink,
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NetworkAttachment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, NetworkAttachment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkAttachment:NetworkAttachment default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkAttachment:NetworkAttachment default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkAttachment:NetworkAttachment default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkAttachment:NetworkAttachment default {{name}}
 * ```
