/**
 * Get the IP address from a static address reserved for a Global Forwarding Rule which are only used for HTTP load balancing. For more information see
 * the official [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/globalAddresses) documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myAddress = gcp.compute.getGlobalAddress({
 *     name: "foobar",
 * });
 * const prod = new gcp.dns.ManagedZone("prod", {dnsName: "prod.mydomain.com."});
 * const frontend = new gcp.dns.RecordSet("frontend", {
 *     type: "A",
 *     ttl: 300,
 *     managedZone: prod.name,
 *     rrdatas: [myAddress.then(myAddress => myAddress.address)],
 * });
 * ```
