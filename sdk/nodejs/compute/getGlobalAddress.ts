/**
 * Get the IP address from a static address reserved for a Global Forwarding Rule which are only used for HTTP load balancing. For more information see
 * the official [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/globalAddresses) documentation.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const google_compute_global_address_my_address = pulumi.output(gcp.compute.getGlobalAddress({
 *     name: "foobar",
 * }));
 * const google_dns_managed_zone_prod = new gcp.dns.ManagedZone("prod", {
 *     dnsName: "prod.mydomain.com.",
 *     name: "prod-zone",
 * });
 * const google_dns_record_set_frontend = new gcp.dns.RecordSet("frontend", {
 *     managedZone: google_dns_managed_zone_prod.name,
 *     name: google_dns_managed_zone_prod.dnsName.apply(__arg0 => `lb.${__arg0}`),
 *     rrdatas: [google_compute_global_address_my_address.apply(__arg0 => __arg0.address)],
 *     ttl: 300,
 *     type: "A",
 * });
 * ```
