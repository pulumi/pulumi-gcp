/**
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Region Security Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_basic = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-basic", {
 *     description: "basic region security policy",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR",
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Region Security Policy With Ddos Protection Config
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_ddos_protection = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-ddos-protection", {
 *     description: "with ddos protection config",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK",
 *     ddosProtectionConfig: {
 *         ddosProtection: "ADVANCED_PREVIEW",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Region Security Policy With User Defined Fields
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_user_defined_fields = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-user-defined-fields", {
 *     description: "with user defined fields",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK",
 *     userDefinedFields: [
 *         {
 *             name: "SIG1_AT_0",
 *             base: "UDP",
 *             offset: 8,
 *             size: 2,
 *             mask: "0x8F00",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "SIG2_AT_8",
 *             base: "UDP",
 *             offset: 16,
 *             size: 4,
 *             mask: "0xFFFFFFFF",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 *
