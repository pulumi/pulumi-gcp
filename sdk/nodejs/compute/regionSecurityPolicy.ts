/**
 * Represents a Region Cloud Armor Security Policy resource.
 *
 * To get more information about RegionSecurityPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionSecurityPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs/security-policy-concepts)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Region Security Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_basic = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-basic", {
 *     name: "my-sec-policy-basic",
 *     description: "basic region security policy",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Region Security Policy With Ddos Protection Config
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_ddos_protection = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-ddos-protection", {
 *     name: "my-sec-policy-ddos-protection",
 *     description: "with ddos protection config",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK",
 *     ddosProtectionConfig: {
 *         ddosProtection: "ADVANCED_PREVIEW",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Region Security Policy With User Defined Fields
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const region_sec_policy_user_defined_fields = new gcp.compute.RegionSecurityPolicy("region-sec-policy-user-defined-fields", {
 *     name: "my-sec-policy-user-defined-fields",
 *     description: "with user defined fields",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK",
 *     userDefinedFields: [
 *         {
 *             name: "SIG1_AT_0",
 *             base: "UDP",
 *             offset: 8,
 *             size: 2,
 *             mask: "0x8F00",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "SIG2_AT_8",
 *             base: "UDP",

 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR",
 *     rules: [
 *         {
 *             action: "deny",
 *             priority: 1000,
 *             match: {
 *                 expr: {
 *                     expression: "request.path.matches(\"/login.html\") && token.recaptcha_session.score < 0.2",
 *                 },
 *             },
 *         },
 *         {
 *             action: "deny",
 *             priority: 2147483647,
 *             match: {
 *                 versionedExpr: "SRC_IPS_V1",
 *                 config: {
 *                     srcIpRanges: ["*"],
 *                 },
 *             },
 *             description: "default rule",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RegionSecurityPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/securityPolicies/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RegionSecurityPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionSecurityPolicy:RegionSecurityPolicy default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/securityPolicies/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionSecurityPolicy:RegionSecurityPolicy default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionSecurityPolicy:RegionSecurityPolicy default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionSecurityPolicy:RegionSecurityPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
