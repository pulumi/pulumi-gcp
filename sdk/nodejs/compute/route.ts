/**
 * Represents a Route resource.
 * 
 * A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
 * the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
 * and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
 * routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
 * searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
 * route.
 * 
 * Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
 * specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
 * the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
 * uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
 * remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
 * the nextHop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
 * machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
 * Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
 * sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.
 * 
 * A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
 * nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, nextHopVpnTunnel, or
 * nextHopIlb.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about Route, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/routes)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Using Routes](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-routes)
 * 
 * ## Example Usage - Route Basic
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("defaultNetwork", {});
 * const defaultRoute = new gcp.compute.Route("defaultRoute", {
 *     destRange: "15.0.0.0/24",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 *     nextHopIp: "10.132.1.5",
 *     priority: 100,
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Example Usage - Route Ilb
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("defaultNetwork", {autoCreateSubnetworks: false});
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("defaultSubnetwork", {
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.1.0/24",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const hc = new gcp.compute.HealthCheck("hc", {
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 *     tcp_health_check: {
 *         port: "80",
 *     },
 * });
 * const backend = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("backend", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: [hc.id],
 * });
 * const defaultForwardingRule = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("defaultForwardingRule", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL",
 *     backendService: backend.id,
 *     allPorts: true,
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.name,
 * });
 * const route-ilb = new gcp.compute.Route("route-ilb", {
 *     destRange: "0.0.0.0/0",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 *     nextHopIlb: defaultForwardingRule.id,
 *     priority: 2000,
 * });
 * ```
