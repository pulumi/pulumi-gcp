/**
 * Represents a RegionTargetHttpsProxy resource, which is used by one or more
 * forwarding rules to route incoming HTTPS requests to a URL map.
 *
 * To get more information about RegionTargetHttpsProxy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionTargetHttpsProxies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/target-proxies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RegionTargetHttpsProxy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/targetHttpsProxies/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RegionTargetHttpsProxy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionTargetHttpsProxy:RegionTargetHttpsProxy default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/targetHttpsProxies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionTargetHttpsProxy:RegionTargetHttpsProxy default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionTargetHttpsProxy:RegionTargetHttpsProxy default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionTargetHttpsProxy:RegionTargetHttpsProxy default {{name}}
 * ```
