/**
 * Get information about a Google Compute Engine Reservation Block. Reservation blocks are automatically created by Google Cloud within reservations and represent a physical grouping of resources.
 *
 * For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)
 * and the [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservationBlocks).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const block = gcp.compute.getReservationBlock({
 *     name: "my-reservation-block",
 *     reservation: "my-reservation",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 * });
 * export const blockStatus = block.then(block => block.status);
 * export const blockInUseCount = block.then(block => block.inUseCount);
