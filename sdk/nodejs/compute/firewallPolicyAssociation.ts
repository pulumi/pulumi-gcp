/**
 * Allows associating hierarchical firewall policies with the target where they are applied. This allows creating policies and rules in a different location than they are applied.
 * For more information on applying hierarchical firewall policies see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/firewall-policies#managing_hierarchical_firewall_policy_resources)
 *
 * To get more information about FirewallPolicyAssociation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/firewallPolicies/addAssociation)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firewall Policy Association
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const folder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("folder", {
 *     displayName: "folder-fpa",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const policy = new gcp.compute.FirewallPolicy("policy", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     shortName: "my-policy",
 *     description: "Example Resource",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyAssociation("default", {
 *     firewallPolicy: policy.id,
 *     attachmentTarget: folder.name,
 *     name: "my-association",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Import
 *
 * FirewallPolicyAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{firewall_policy}}/associations/{{name}}`
 * * `{{firewall_policy}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FirewallPolicyAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyAssociation:FirewallPolicyAssociation default locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{firewall_policy}}/associations/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyAssociation:FirewallPolicyAssociation default {{firewall_policy}}/{{name}}
 * ```
