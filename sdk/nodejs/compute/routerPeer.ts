/**
 * BGP information that must be configured into the routing stack to
 * establish BGP peering. This information must specify the peer ASN
 * and either the interface name, IP address, or peer IP address.
 * Please refer to RFC4273.
 *
 * To get more information about RouterBgpPeer, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/routers)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Google Cloud Router](https://cloud.google.com/router/docs/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Router Peer Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const peer = new gcp.compute.RouterPeer("peer", {
 *     name: "my-router-peer",
 *     router: "my-router",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     peerAsn: 65513,
 *     advertisedRoutePriority: 100,
 *     "interface": "interface-1",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Router Peer Disabled
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const peer = new gcp.compute.RouterPeer("peer", {
 *     name: "my-router-peer",
 *     router: "my-router",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     peerIpAddress: "169.254.1.2",
 *     peerAsn: 65513,
 *     advertisedRoutePriority: 100,
 *     "interface": "interface-1",
 *     enable: false,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Router Peer Bfd
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const peer = new gcp.compute.RouterPeer("peer", {
 *     name: "my-router-peer",
 *     router: "my-router",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     peerIpAddress: "169.254.1.2",
 *     peerAsn: 65513,
 *     advertisedRoutePriority: 100,
 *     "interface": "interface-1",
 *     bfd: {
 *         minReceiveInterval: 1000,
 *         minTransmitInterval: 1000,
 *         multiplier: 5,
 *         sessionInitializationMode: "ACTIVE",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Router Zero Custom Learend Route Priority
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const peer = new gcp.compute.RouterPeer("peer", {
 *     name: "my-router-peer",

 *     peerAsn: 65513,
 *     customLearnedRoutePriority: 0,
 *     zeroCustomLearnedRoutePriority: true,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Router Zero Advertised Route Priority
 *

 *
 * const peer = new gcp.compute.RouterPeer("peer", {
 *     name: "my-router-peer",
