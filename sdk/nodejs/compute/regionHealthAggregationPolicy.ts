/**
 * The Health Aggregation Policy specifies how to aggregate the service's constituent source health status to determine an aggregated health status result for the service.  For example, you can specify a criteria such as “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if there are at least 5 healthy backend endpoints”. Or, you can specify a criteria like “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if minimum 60% of endpoints in the Backend are healthy”. The Health Aggregation Policy is applied to each Health Source (e.g. Backend Service) individually.

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Compute Region Health Aggregation Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const exampleTestHealthAggregationPolicy = new gcp.compute.RegionHealthAggregationPolicy("example_test_health_aggregation_policy", {
 *     name: "test-health-aggregation-policy",
 *     description: "Example health aggregation policy basic",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RegionHealthAggregationPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/healthAggregationPolicies/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RegionHealthAggregationPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionHealthAggregationPolicy:RegionHealthAggregationPolicy default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/healthAggregationPolicies/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionHealthAggregationPolicy:RegionHealthAggregationPolicy default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionHealthAggregationPolicy:RegionHealthAggregationPolicy default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionHealthAggregationPolicy:RegionHealthAggregationPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
