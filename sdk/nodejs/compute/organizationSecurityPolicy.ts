/**
 * Organization security policies are used to control incoming/outgoing traffic.
 *
 * To get more information about OrganizationSecurityPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizationSecurityPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating a firewall policy](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewall-policies#create-policy)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Organization Security Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const policy = new gcp.compute.OrganizationSecurityPolicy("policy", {
 *     shortName: "my-short-name",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     type: "CLOUD_ARMOR",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}`
 * * `{{policy_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/organizationSecurityPolicy:OrganizationSecurityPolicy default locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/organizationSecurityPolicy:OrganizationSecurityPolicy default {{policy_id}}
 * ```
