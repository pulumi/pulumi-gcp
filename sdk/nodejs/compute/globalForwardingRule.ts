/**
 * Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are
 * used to forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load
 * balancing. Global forwarding rules can only be used for HTTP load
 * balancing.
 *
 * For more information, see
 * https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Global Forwarding Rule Http
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHttpHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HttpHealthCheck("defaultHttpHealthCheck", {
 *     requestPath: "/",
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 * });
 * const defaultBackendService = new gcp.compute.BackendService("defaultBackendService", {
 *     portName: "http",
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     timeoutSec: 10,
 *     healthChecks: [defaultHttpHealthCheck.id],
 * });
 * const defaultURLMap = new gcp.compute.URLMap("defaultURLMap", {
 *     description: "a description",
 *     defaultService: defaultBackendService.id,
 *     hostRules: [{
 *         hosts: ["mysite.com"],

 * });
 * const defaultTargetHttpProxy = new gcp.compute.TargetHttpProxy("defaultTargetHttpProxy", {
