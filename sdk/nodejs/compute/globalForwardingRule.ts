 * Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GlobalForwardingRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalForwardingRule:GlobalForwardingRule default projects/{{project}}/global/forwardingRules/{{name}}
