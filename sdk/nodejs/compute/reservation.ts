/**
 * Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is
 * held in a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.
 *
 * Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
 * Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
 * `g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
 * services not listed above
 * like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.
 *
 * To get more information about Reservation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving zonal resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Reservation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gceReservation = new gcp.compute.Reservation("gce_reservation", {
 *     name: "gce-reservation",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     specificReservation: {
 *         count: 1,
 *         instanceProperties: {
 *             minCpuPlatform: "Intel Cascade Lake",
 *             machineType: "n2-standard-2",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Reservation Basic Beta
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gceReservation = new gcp.compute.Reservation("gce_reservation", {
 *     name: "gce-reservation",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     specificReservation: {
 *         count: 1,
 *         instanceProperties: {
 *             minCpuPlatform: "Intel Cascade Lake",
 *             machineType: "n2-standard-2",
 *             maintenanceInterval: "PERIODIC",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     enableEmergentMaintenance: true,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Reservation Source Instance Template
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myImage = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-11",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",
 * });
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.InstanceTemplate("foobar", {
 *     name: "instance-template",
 *     machineType: "n2-standard-2",
 *     canIpForward: false,
 *     tags: [
 *         "foo",
 *         "bar",
 *     ],
 *     disks: [{
 *         sourceImage: myImage.then(myImage => myImage.selfLink),
 *         autoDelete: true,
 *         boot: true,
 *     }],
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *     }],
 *     scheduling: {
 *         preemptible: false,
 *         automaticRestart: true,
 *     },
 *     metadata: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     serviceAccount: {
 *         scopes: [
 *             "userinfo-email",
 *             "compute-ro",
 *             "storage-ro",
 *         ],
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         my_label: "foobar",
 *     },
 * });
 * const gceReservationSourceInstanceTemplate = new gcp.compute.Reservation("gce_reservation_source_instance_template", {
 *     name: "gce-reservation-source-instance-template",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     specificReservation: {
 *         count: 1,
 *         sourceInstanceTemplate: foobar.selfLink,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Reservation Sharing Policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

 *
 * const myImage = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-11",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",

 *         ],
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         my_label: "foobar",
 *     },
 * });
 * const gceReservationSharingPolicy = new gcp.compute.Reservation("gce_reservation_sharing_policy", {
 *     name: "gce-reservation-sharing-policy",
 *     zone: "us-central1-b",
 *     specificReservation: {
 *         count: 2,
 *         sourceInstanceTemplate: foobar.selfLink,
 *     },
 *     reservationSharingPolicy: {
 *         serviceShareType: "ALLOW_ALL",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/reservations/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{zone}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Reservation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/reservations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{name}}
 * ```
