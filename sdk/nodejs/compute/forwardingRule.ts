/**
 * A ForwardingRule resource. A ForwardingRule resource specifies which pool
 * of target virtual machines to forward a packet to if it matches the given
 * [IPAddress, IPProtocol, portRange] tuple.
 *
 * To get more information about ForwardingRule, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/forwardingRules)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/forwarding-rules)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Forwarding Rule Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultTargetPool = new gcp.compute.TargetPool("defaultTargetPool", {});
 * const defaultForwardingRule = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("defaultForwardingRule", {
 *     target: defaultTargetPool.id,
 *     portRange: "80",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ForwardingRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{name}}
 * ```
