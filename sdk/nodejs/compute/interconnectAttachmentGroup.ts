/**
 * An interconnect attachment group resource allows customers to create,
 * analyze, and expand highly available deployments.
 *
 * To get more information about InterconnectAttachmentGroup, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnects)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Create a Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Interconnect Attachment Group Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example_interconnect_attachment_group = new gcp.compute.InterconnectAttachmentGroup("example-interconnect-attachment-group", {
 *     name: "example-interconnect-attachment-group",
 *     intent: {
 *         availabilitySla: "NO_SLA",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * InterconnectAttachmentGroup can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectAttachmentGroups/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, InterconnectAttachmentGroup can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachmentGroup:InterconnectAttachmentGroup default projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectAttachmentGroups/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachmentGroup:InterconnectAttachmentGroup default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachmentGroup:InterconnectAttachmentGroup default {{name}}
 * ```
