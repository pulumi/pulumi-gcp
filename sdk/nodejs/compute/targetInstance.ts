/**
 * Represents a TargetInstance resource which defines an endpoint instance
 * that terminates traffic of certain protocols. In particular, they are used
 * in Protocol Forwarding, where forwarding rules can send packets to a
 * non-NAT'ed target instance. Each target instance contains a single
 * virtual machine instance that receives and handles traffic from the
 * corresponding forwarding rules.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about TargetInstance, see:
