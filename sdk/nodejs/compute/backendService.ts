/**
 * A Backend Service defines a group of virtual machines that will serve
 * traffic for load balancing. This resource is a global backend service,
 * appropriate for external load balancing or self-managed internal load balancing.
 * For managed internal load balancing, use a regional backend service instead.
 *
 * Currently self-managed internal load balancing is only available in beta.
 *
 * > **Note:** Recreating a `gcp.compute.BackendService` that references other dependent resources like `gcp.compute.URLMap` will give a `resourceInUseByAnotherResource` error, when modifying the number of other dependent resources.
 * Use `lifecycle.create_before_destroy` on the dependent resources to avoid this type of error as shown in the Dynamic Backends example.
 *
 * To get more information about BackendService, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/backendServices)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/backend-service)
 *
 * > **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
 * values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `iap.oauth2_client_secret`, `iap.oauth2_client_secret_sha256`, `security_settings.aws_v4_authentication.access_key`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Backend Service Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHttpHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HttpHealthCheck("default", {
 *     name: "health-check",
 *     requestPath: "/",
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.BackendService("default", {
 *     name: "backend-service",
 *     healthChecks: defaultHttpHealthCheck.id,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backend Service External Iap
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.BackendService("default", {
 *     name: "tf-test-backend-service-external",
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "EXTERNAL",
 *     iap: {
 *         enabled: true,
 *         oauth2ClientId: "abc",
 *         oauth2ClientSecret: "xyz",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backend Service Cache Simple
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHttpHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HttpHealthCheck("default", {
 *     name: "health-check",
 *     requestPath: "/",
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.BackendService("default", {
 *     name: "backend-service",
 *     healthChecks: defaultHttpHealthCheck.id,
 *     enableCdn: true,
 *     cdnPolicy: {
 *         signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: 7200,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backend Service Cache Include Http Headers
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";

 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backend Service Cache
 *
 * ```typescript

 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/backendServices/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, BackendService can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default projects/{{project}}/global/backendServices/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default {{name}}
 * ```

     * The possible values are:
     * * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
     * is selected in round robin order.
     * * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
     * hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
     * * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
     * hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
     * addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
     * 1/N of the requests.
     * * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
     * * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
     * connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
     * to the same address as the destination address of
     * the incoming connection before the connection
     * was redirected to the load balancer.
     * * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.

     * non-standard HTTP response header field
     * X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the

     * based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
     * processed health check replies, as long as every
     * instance either reported a valid weight or had
     * UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
     * equal-weight.
     * * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
     * from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
     * responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
     * X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics

     * * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network

     * hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
