     * The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
     * The possible values are -
     * ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
     * is selected in round robin order.
     * LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
     * hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
     * RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
     * hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
     * addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
     * 1/N of the requests.
     * RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
     * ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
     * connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
     * to the same address as the destination address of
     * the incoming connection before the connection
     * was redirected to the load balancer.
     * MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
     * Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
     * build times and host selection times. For more information about
     * Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
