/**
 * Enables the Google Compute Engine
 * [Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc)
 * feature for a project, assigning it as a Shared VPC host project.
 *
 * For more information, see,
 * [the Project API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/projects),
 * where the Shared VPC feature is referred to by its former name "XPN".
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // A host project provides network resources to associated service projects.
 * const host = new gcp.compute.SharedVPCHostProject("host", {project: "host-project-id"});
 * // A service project gains access to network resources provided by its
 * // associated host project.
 * const service1 = new gcp.compute.SharedVPCServiceProject("service1", {
 *     hostProject: host.project,
 *     serviceProject: "service-project-id-1",
 * });
 * const service2 = new gcp.compute.SharedVPCServiceProject("service2", {
 *     hostProject: host.project,
 *     serviceProject: "service-project-id-2",
 * });
 * ```
