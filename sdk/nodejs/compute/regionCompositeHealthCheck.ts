/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Compute Region Composite Health Check Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const hap = new gcp.compute.RegionHealthAggregationPolicy("hap", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-hap",
 *     description: "health aggregation policy for health source",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * const defaultHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HealthCheck("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-hc",
 *     httpHealthCheck: {
 *         port: 80,
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultRegionBackendService = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-bs",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: defaultHealthCheck.id,
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.RegionHealthSource("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-hs",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     sourceType: "BACKEND_SERVICE",
 *     sources: defaultRegionBackendService.id,
 *     healthAggregationPolicy: hap.id,
 * });
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-net",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-sub",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.2.0.0/16",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const defaultForwardingRule = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("default", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check-fr",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL",
 *     backendService: defaultRegionBackendService.id,
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.id,
 *     ipProtocol: "TCP",
 *     allPorts: true,
 * });
 * const exampleTestCompositeHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.RegionCompositeHealthCheck("example_test_composite_health_check", {
 *     name: "test-composite-health-check",
 *     description: "test regional composite health check resource",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthSources: [_default.id],
 *     healthDestination: defaultForwardingRule.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RegionCompositeHealthCheck can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/compositeHealthChecks/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RegionCompositeHealthCheck can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCompositeHealthCheck:RegionCompositeHealthCheck default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/compositeHealthChecks/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCompositeHealthCheck:RegionCompositeHealthCheck default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCompositeHealthCheck:RegionCompositeHealthCheck default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCompositeHealthCheck:RegionCompositeHealthCheck default {{name}}
 * ```
