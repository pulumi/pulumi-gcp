/**
 * Represents a Global Address resource. Global addresses are used for
 * HTTP(S) load balancing.
 *
 * To get more information about GlobalAddress, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/globalAddresses)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Global Address Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("default", {name: "global-appserver-ip"});
 * ```
 * ### Global Address Private Services Connect
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "my-network-name",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("default", {
 *     name: "global-psconnect-ip",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     purpose: "PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT",
 *     network: network.id,
 *     address: "100.100.100.105",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GlobalAddress can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/addresses/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, GlobalAddress can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default projects/{{project}}/global/addresses/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default {{name}}
 * ```
