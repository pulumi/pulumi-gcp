/**
 * List IP addresses in a project. For more information see
 * the official API [list](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/addresses/list) and
 * [aggregated list](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/addresses/aggregatedList) documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = gcp.compute.getAddresses({
 *     filter: "name:test-*",
 * });
 * const prod = new gcp.dns.ManagedZone("prod", {
 *     name: "prod-zone",
 *     dnsName: "prod.mydomain.com.",
 * });
 * const frontend = new gcp.dns.RecordSet("frontend", {
 *     name: pulumi.interpolate`frontend.${prod.dnsName}`,
 *     type: "A",
 *     ttl: 300,
 *     managedZone: prod.name,
 *     rrdatas: test.then(test => test.addresses.map(__item => __item.address)),
 * });
 * ```
