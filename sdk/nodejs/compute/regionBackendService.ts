/**
 * A Region Backend Service defines a regionally-scoped group of virtual
 * machines that will serve traffic for load balancing.
 *
 *
 * To get more information about RegionBackendService, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/regionBackendServices)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage - Region Backend Service Basic
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HealthCheck("defaultHealthCheck", {
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 *     tcp_health_check: {
 *         port: "80",
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultRegionBackendService = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("defaultRegionBackendService", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: [defaultHealthCheck.id],
 *     connectionDrainingTimeoutSec: 10,
 *     sessionAffinity: "CLIENT_IP",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Example Usage - Region Backend Service Ilb Round Robin
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const healthCheck = new gcp.compute.HealthCheck("healthCheck", {http_health_check: {
 *     port: 80,
 * }});
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("default", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: [healthCheck.id],
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL_MANAGED",
 *     localityLbPolicy: "ROUND_ROBIN",
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Example Usage - Region Backend Service Ilb Ring Hash
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const healthCheck = new gcp.compute.HealthCheck("healthCheck", {http_health_check: {
 *     port: 80,
 * }});
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("default", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: [healthCheck.id],
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL_MANAGED",
 *     localityLbPolicy: "RING_HASH",
 *     sessionAffinity: "HTTP_COOKIE",
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     circuit_breakers: {
 *         maxConnections: 10,
 *     },
 *     consistent_hash: {
 *         http_cookie: {
 *             ttl: {
 *                 seconds: 11,
 *                 nanos: 1111,
 *             },
 *             name: "mycookie",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     outlier_detection: {
 *         consecutiveErrors: 2,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Example Usage - Region Backend Service Balancing Mode
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

 *         boot: true,
 *     }],
 *     tags: [
 *         "allow-ssh",
 *         "load-balanced-backend",
 *     ],
 * });
 * const rigm = new gcp.compute.RegionInstanceGroupManager("rigm", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     version: [{
 *         instanceTemplate: instanceTemplate.selfLink,
 *         name: "primary",
 *     }],
 *     baseInstanceName: "internal-glb",
 *     targetSize: 1,
 * });
 * const defaultRegionHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.RegionHealthCheck("defaultRegionHealthCheck", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     http_health_check: {
 *         portSpecification: "USE_SERVING_PORT",
 *     },
 * });
