/**
 * Represents an Address resource.
 *
 * Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
 * optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
 * the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
 * communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
 * you must specify the instance's external IP address.
 *
 * Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
 * the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
 * the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
 * Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
 * static.
 *
 * To get more information about Address, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/beta/addresses)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network)
 *     * [Reserving a Static Internal IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Address Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const ipAddress = new gcp.compute.Address("ip_address", {name: "my-address"});
 * ```
 * ### Address With Subnetwork
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {name: "my-network"});
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("default", {
 *     name: "my-subnet",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/16",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: _default.id,
 * });
 * const internalWithSubnetAndAddress = new gcp.compute.Address("internal_with_subnet_and_address", {
 *     name: "my-internal-address",
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.id,
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     address: "10.0.42.42",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Address With Gce Endpoint
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const internalWithGceEndpoint = new gcp.compute.Address("internal_with_gce_endpoint", {
 *     name: "my-internal-address-",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     purpose: "GCE_ENDPOINT",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Instance With Ip
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const static = new gcp.compute.Address("static", {name: "ipv4-address"});
 * const debianImage = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-11",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",
 * });
 * const instanceWithIp = new gcp.compute.Instance("instance_with_ip", {
 *     name: "vm-instance",
 *     machineType: "f1-micro",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: debianImage.then(debianImage => debianImage.selfLink),
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *         accessConfigs: [{
 *             natIp: static.address,
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Compute Address Ipsec Interconnect
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "test-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const ipsec_interconnect_address = new gcp.compute.Address("ipsec-interconnect-address", {
 *     name: "test-address",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     purpose: "IPSEC_INTERCONNECT",
 *     address: "192.168.1.0",
 *     prefixLength: 29,
 *     network: network.selfLink,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Address can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/addresses/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Address can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/addresses/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{name}}
 * ```
