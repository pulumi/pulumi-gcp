/**
 * Represents an InterconnectAttachment (VLAN attachment) resource. For more
 * information, see Creating VLAN Attachments.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Interconnect Attachment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.Router("foobar", {network: google_compute_network.foobar.name});
 * const onPrem = new gcp.compute.InterconnectAttachment("onPrem", {
 *     interconnect: "my-interconnect-id",
 *     router: foobar.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * InterconnectAttachment can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/interconnectAttachments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{name}}
 * ```
