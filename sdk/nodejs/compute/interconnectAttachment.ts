/**
 * Represents an InterconnectAttachment (VLAN attachment) resource. For more
 * information, see Creating VLAN Attachments.
 *
 * To get more information about InterconnectAttachment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnectAttachments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Create a Interconnect attachment](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/how-to/dedicated/creating-vlan-attachments)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Interconnect Attachment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobarNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("foobar", {
 *     name: "network-1",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.Router("foobar", {
 *     name: "router-1",
 *     network: foobarNetwork.name,
 *     bgp: {
 *         asn: 16550,
 *     },
 * });
 * const onPrem = new gcp.compute.InterconnectAttachment("on_prem", {
 *     name: "on-prem-attachment",
 *     edgeAvailabilityDomain: "AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1",
 *     type: "PARTNER",
 *     router: foobar.id,
 *     mtu: "1500",
 *     labels: {
 *         mykey: "myvalue",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Compute Interconnect Attachment Ipsec Encryption
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "test-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const address = new gcp.compute.Address("address", {
 *     name: "test-address",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     purpose: "IPSEC_INTERCONNECT",
 *     address: "192.168.1.0",
 *     prefixLength: 29,
 *     network: network.selfLink,
 * });
 * const router = new gcp.compute.Router("router", {
 *     name: "test-router",
 *     network: network.name,
 *     encryptedInterconnectRouter: true,
 *     bgp: {
 *         asn: 16550,
 *     },
 * });
 * const ipsec_encrypted_interconnect_attachment = new gcp.compute.InterconnectAttachment("ipsec-encrypted-interconnect-attachment", {
 *     name: "test-interconnect-attachment",
 *     edgeAvailabilityDomain: "AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1",
 *     type: "PARTNER",
 *     router: router.id,
 *     encryption: "IPSEC",
 *     ipsecInternalAddresses: [address.selfLink],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Compute Interconnect Attachment Custom Ranges
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobarNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("foobar", {
 *     name: "test-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.Router("foobar", {
 *     name: "test-router",
 *     network: foobarNetwork.name,
 *     bgp: {
 *         asn: 16550,
 *     },
 * });
 * const custom_ranges_interconnect_attachment = new gcp.compute.InterconnectAttachment("custom-ranges-interconnect-attachment", {
 *     name: "test-custom-ranges-interconnect-attachment",
 *     edgeAvailabilityDomain: "AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1",
 *     type: "PARTNER",
 *     router: foobar.id,
 *     mtu: "1500",
 *     stackType: "IPV4_IPV6",
 *     labels: {
 *         mykey: "myvalue",
 *     },
 *     candidateCloudRouterIpAddress: "192.169.0.1/29",
 *     candidateCustomerRouterIpAddress: "192.169.0.2/29",
 *     candidateCloudRouterIpv6Address: "748d:2f23:6651:9455:828b:ca81:6fe0:fed1/125",
 *     candidateCustomerRouterIpv6Address: "748d:2f23:6651:9455:828b:ca81:6fe0:fed2/125",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * InterconnectAttachment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/interconnectAttachments/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, InterconnectAttachment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/interconnectAttachments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectAttachment:InterconnectAttachment default {{name}}
 * ```
