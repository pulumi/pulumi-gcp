/**
 * Represents an Interconnect resource. The Interconnect resource is a dedicated connection between
 * Google's network and your on-premises network.
 *
 * To get more information about Interconnect, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnects)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Create a Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Compute Interconnect Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const example_interconnect = new gcp.compute.Interconnect("example-interconnect", {
 *     name: "example-interconnect",
 *     customerName: "example_customer",
 *     interconnectType: "DEDICATED",
 *     linkType: "LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR",
 *     location: project.then(project => `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/${project.id}/global/interconnectLocations/iad-zone1-1`),
 *     requestedLinkCount: 1,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Interconnect can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnects/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Interconnect can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnect:Interconnect default projects/{{project}}/global/interconnects/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnect:Interconnect default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnect:Interconnect default {{name}}
 * ```
