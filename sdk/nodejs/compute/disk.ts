/**
 * Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
 * the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
 * hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
 * performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
 * hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
 *
 * Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
 * instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
 * even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
 * automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
 * or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
 * storage space requirements.
 *
 * Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
 * affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.
 *
 * To get more information about Disk, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/disks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Disk Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Disk("default", {
 *     name: "test-disk",
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     image: "debian-11-bullseye-v20220719",
 *     labels: {
 *         environment: "dev",
 *     },
 *     physicalBlockSizeBytes: 4096,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Disk Async
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.compute.Disk("primary", {
 *     name: "async-test-disk",
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     physicalBlockSizeBytes: 4096,
 * });
 * const secondary = new gcp.compute.Disk("secondary", {
 *     name: "async-secondary-test-disk",
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-east1-c",
 *     asyncPrimaryDisk: {
 *         disk: primary.id,
 *     },
 *     physicalBlockSizeBytes: 4096,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Disk Features
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Disk("default", {
 *     name: "test-disk-features",
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     labels: {
 *         environment: "dev",
 *     },
 *     guestOsFeatures: [
 *         {
 *             type: "SECURE_BOOT",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             type: "MULTI_IP_SUBNET",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             type: "WINDOWS",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     licenses: ["https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/windows-cloud/global/licenses/windows-server-core"],
 *     physicalBlockSizeBytes: 4096,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Disk can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/disks/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{zone}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Disk can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/disk:Disk default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/disks/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/disk:Disk default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/disk:Disk default {{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/disk:Disk default {{name}}
 * ```
