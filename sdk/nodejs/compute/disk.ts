/**
 * Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
 * the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
 * hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
 * performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
 * hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
 * 
 * Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
 * instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
 * even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
 * automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
 * or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
 * storage space requirements.
 * 
 * Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
 * affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about Disk, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/disks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)
 * 
 * > **Warning:** All arguments including the disk encryption key will be stored in the raw
 * state as plain-text.
 * [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
 * 
 * ## Example Usage - Disk Basic
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const defaultDisk = new gcp.compute.Disk("default", {
 *     image: "debian-8-jessie-v20170523",
 *     labels: {
 *         environment: "dev",
 *     },
 *     physicalBlockSizeBytes: 4096,
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 * });
