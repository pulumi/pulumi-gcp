/**
 * Persistent disks can be attached to a compute instance using the `attachedDisk`
 * section within the compute instance configuration.
 * However there may be situations where managing the attached disks via the compute
 * instance config isn't preferable or possible, such as attaching dynamic
 * numbers of disks using the `count` variable.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about attaching disks, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/attachDisk)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)
 * 
 * **Note:** When using `gcp.compute.AttachedDisk` you **must** use `lifecycle.ignore_changes = ["attachedDisk"]` on the `gcp.compute.Instance` resource that has the disks attached. Otherwise the two resources will fight for control of the attached disk block.
