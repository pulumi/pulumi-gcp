/**
 * Persistent disks can be attached to a compute instance using the `attachedDisk`
 * section within the compute instance configuration.
 * However there may be situations where managing the attached disks via the compute
 * instance config isn't preferable or possible, such as attaching dynamic
 * numbers of disks using the `count` variable.
 *
 * To get more information about attaching disks, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/attachDisk)
 * * Resource: gcp.compute.Disk
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)
 *
 * **Note:** When using `gcp.compute.AttachedDisk` you **must** use `lifecycle.ignore_changes = ["attachedDisk"]` on the `gcp.compute.Instance` resource that has the disks attached. Otherwise the two resources will fight for control of the attached disk block.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultInstance = new gcp.compute.Instance("default", {
 *     name: "attached-disk-instance",
 *     machineType: "e2-medium",
 *     zone: "us-west1-a",
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: "debian-cloud/debian-11",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.AttachedDisk("default", {
 *     disk: defaultGoogleComputeDisk.id,
 *     instance: defaultInstance.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Attached Disk can be imported the following ways:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/instances/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{zone}}/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Attached Disk can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/attachedDisk:AttachedDisk default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/instances/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/attachedDisk:AttachedDisk default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}
 * ```
