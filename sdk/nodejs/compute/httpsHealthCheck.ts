/**
 * An HttpsHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
 * individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTPS.
 *
 * > **Note:** gcp.compute.HttpsHealthCheck is a legacy health check.
 * The newer [gcp.compute.HealthCheck](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html)
 * should be preferred for all uses except
 * [Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
 * which still require the legacy version.
 *
 * To get more information about HttpsHealthCheck, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/httpsHealthChecks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding Health Checks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks#legacy_health_checks)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Https Health Check Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.HttpsHealthCheck("default", {
 *     name: "authentication-health-check",
 *     requestPath: "/health_check",
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * HttpsHealthCheck can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/httpsHealthChecks/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, HttpsHealthCheck can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpsHealthCheck:HttpsHealthCheck default projects/{{project}}/global/httpsHealthChecks/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpsHealthCheck:HttpsHealthCheck default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpsHealthCheck:HttpsHealthCheck default {{name}}
 * ```
