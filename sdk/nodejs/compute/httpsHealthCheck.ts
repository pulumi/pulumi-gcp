/**
 * An HttpsHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
 * individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTPS.
 *
 *
 * > **Note:** gcp.compute.HttpsHealthCheck is a legacy health check.
 * The newer [gcp.compute.HealthCheck](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html)
 * should be preferred for all uses except
 * [Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
 * which still require the legacy version.
 *
 *
 * To get more information about HttpsHealthCheck, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/httpsHealthChecks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Adding Health Checks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks#legacy_health_checks)
 *
 * ## Example Usage - Https Health Check Basic
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHttpsHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HttpsHealthCheck("default", {
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     requestPath: "/health_check",
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 * });
 * ```
