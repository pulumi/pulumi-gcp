/**
 * Manages a VPC network or legacy network resource on GCP.
 *
 * To get more information about Network, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Network Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const vpcNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("vpc_network", {});
 * ```
 * ### Network Custom Mtu
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const vpcNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("vpc_network", {
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: true,
 *     mtu: 1460,
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Network can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/network:Network default projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/network:Network default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/network:Network default {{name}}
 * ```
