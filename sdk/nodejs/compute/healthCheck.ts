/**
 * Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
 * They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
 * as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.
 *
 * Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
 * do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
 * as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
 * though existing connections will continue. The health check will
 * continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
 * successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
 * healthy again and can receive new connections.
 *
 * ~>**NOTE**: Legacy HTTP(S) health checks must be used for target pool-based network
 * load balancers. See the [official guide](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#selecting_hc)
 * for choosing a type of health check.
 *
 * To get more information about HealthCheck, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/healthChecks)
 * * How-to Guides

 * ## Import
 *
 * HealthCheck can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/healthChecks/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, HealthCheck can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/healthCheck:HealthCheck default projects/{{project}}/global/healthChecks/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/healthCheck:HealthCheck default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/healthCheck:HealthCheck default {{name}}
 * ```
