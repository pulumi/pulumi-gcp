/**
 * Hierarchical firewall policy rules let you create and enforce a consistent firewall policy across your organization. Rules can explicitly allow or deny connections or delegate evaluation to lower level policies.
 *
 * For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewall-policies#create-rules)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultFirewallPolicy = new gcp.compute.FirewallPolicy("defaultFirewallPolicy", {
 *     parent: "organizations/12345",
 *     shortName: "my-policy",
 *     description: "Example Resource",
 * });
 * const defaultFirewallPolicyRule = new gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyRule("defaultFirewallPolicyRule", {
 *     firewallPolicy: defaultFirewallPolicy.id,
 *     description: "Example Resource",
 *     priority: 9000,
 *     enableLogging: true,
 *     action: "allow",
 *     direction: "EGRESS",
 *     disabled: false,
 *     match: {
 *         layer4Configs: [{
 *             ipProtocol: "tcp",
 *             ports: [
 *                 "80",
 *                 "8080",
 *             ],
 *         }],
 *         destIpRanges: ["11.100.0.1/32"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FirewallPolicyRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyRule:FirewallPolicyRule default locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{firewall_policy}}/rules/{{priority}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyRule:FirewallPolicyRule default {{firewall_policy}}/{{priority}}
 * ```
