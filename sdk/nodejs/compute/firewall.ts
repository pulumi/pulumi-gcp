/**
 * Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
 * instances.
 *
 * All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
 * firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.
 *
 * The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
 * shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
 * automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
 * outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
 * networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
 * you need.
 *
 * To get more information about Firewall, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/firewalls)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firewall Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("default", {name: "test-network"});
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.Firewall("default", {
 *     name: "test-firewall",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 *     allows: [
 *         {
 *             protocol: "icmp",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             protocol: "tcp",
 *             ports: [
 *                 "80",
 *                 "8080",
 *                 "1000-2000",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     sourceTags: ["web"],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firewall With Target Tags
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const rules = new gcp.compute.Firewall("rules", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     name: "my-firewall-rule",
 *     network: "default",
 *     description: "Creates firewall rule targeting tagged instances",
 *     allows: [{
 *         protocol: "tcp",
 *         ports: [
 *             "80",
 *             "8080",
 *             "1000-2000",
 *         ],
 *     }],
 *     sourceTags: ["foo"],
 *     targetTags: ["web"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Firewall can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/firewalls/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Firewall can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewall:Firewall default projects/{{project}}/global/firewalls/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewall:Firewall default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewall:Firewall default {{name}}
 * ```
