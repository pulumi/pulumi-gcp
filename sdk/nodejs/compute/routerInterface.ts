/**
 * Manages a Cloud Router interface. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cloudrouter)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/routers).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.RouterInterface("foobar", {
 *     name: "interface-1",
 *     router: "router-1",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     ipRange: "169.254.1.1/30",
 *     vpnTunnel: "tunnel-1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Router interfaces can be imported using the `project` (optional), `region`, `router`, and `name`, e.g.
 *
 * * `{{project_id}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, router interfaces can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerInterface:RouterInterface default {{project_id}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerInterface:RouterInterface default {{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}
 * ```
