/**
 * Manages a Cloud Router interface. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cloudrouter)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/routers).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.RouterInterface("foobar", {
 *     ipRange: "169.254.1.1/30",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     router: "router-1",
 *     vpnTunnel: "tunnel-1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Router interfaces can be imported using the `region`, `router`, and `name`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerInterface:RouterInterface foobar us-central1/router-1/interface-1
 * ```
