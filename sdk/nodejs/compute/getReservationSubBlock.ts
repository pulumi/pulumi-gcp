/**
 * Get information about a Google Compute Engine Reservation Sub-Block. Reservation sub-blocks are automatically created by Google Cloud within reservation blocks and represent a finer-grained physical grouping of resources.
 *
 * For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)
 * and the [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservationSubBlocks).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const subBlock = gcp.compute.getReservationSubBlock({
 *     name: "my-reservation-sub-block",
 *     reservationBlock: "my-reservation-block",
 *     reservation: "my-reservation",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 * });
 * export const subBlockStatus = subBlock.then(subBlock => subBlock.status);
 * export const subBlockHealth = subBlock.then(subBlock => subBlock.healthInfos);
 * ```
