/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Organization Security Policy Rule Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const policy = new gcp.compute.OrganizationSecurityPolicy("policy", {
 *     displayName: "tf-test",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     type: "FIREWALL",
 * });
 * const policyOrganizationSecurityPolicyRule = new gcp.compute.OrganizationSecurityPolicyRule("policy", {
 *     policyId: policy.id,
 *     action: "allow",
 *     direction: "INGRESS",
 *     enableLogging: true,
 *     match: {
 *         config: {
 *             srcIpRanges: [
 *                 "192.168.0.0/16",
 *                 "10.0.0.0/8",
 *             ],
 *             layer4Configs: [
 *                 {
 *                     ipProtocol: "tcp",
 *                     ports: ["22"],
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     ipProtocol: "icmp",
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 *     priority: 100,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * OrganizationSecurityPolicyRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{policy_id}}/priority/{{priority}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, OrganizationSecurityPolicyRule can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/organizationSecurityPolicyRule:OrganizationSecurityPolicyRule default {{policy_id}}/priority/{{priority}}
 * ```
