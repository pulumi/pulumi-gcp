/**
 * Patch deployments are configurations that individual patch jobs use to complete a patch.
 * These configurations include instance filter, package repository settings, and a schedule.
 *
 *
 * To get more information about PatchDeployment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-patch-management)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Os Config Patch Deployment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const patch = new gcp.osconfig.PatchDeployment("patch", {
 *     instanceFilter: {
 *         all: true,
 *     },
 *     patchDeploymentId: "patch-deploy-inst",
 *     recurringSchedule: {
 *         timeOfDay: {
 *             hours: 1,
 *         },
 *         timeZone: {
 *             id: "America/New_York",
 *         },
 *         weekly: {
 *             dayOfWeek: "MONDAY",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Os Config Patch Deployment Instance
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myImage = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-9",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",
 * });
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.Instance("foobar", {
 *     machineType: "n1-standard-1",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     canIpForward: false,
 *     tags: [
 *         "foo",

 *     boot_disk: {
 *         initialize_params: {
 *             image: myImage.then(myImage => myImage.selfLink),
 *         },
 *     },
 *     network_interface: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *     }],
 *     metadata: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * const patch = new gcp.osconfig.PatchDeployment("patch", {
 *     patchDeploymentId: "patch-deploy-inst",
 *     instance_filter: {
 *         instances: [foobar.id],
 *     },
 *     patch_config: {
 *         yum: {
 *             security: true,
 *             minimal: true,
 *             excludes: ["bash"],
 *         },
 *     },
 *     recurring_schedule: {
 *         time_zone: {
 *             id: "America/New_York",
 *         },
 *         time_of_day: {
 *             hours: 0,
 *             minutes: 30,
 *             seconds: 30,
 *             nanos: 20,
 *         },
 *         monthly: {
