 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Certificate Manager Google Managed Certificate Dns
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("instance", {
 *     description: "The default dnss",

 * });
 * const instance2 = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("instance2", {
