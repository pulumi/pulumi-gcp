/**
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Certificate Manager Certificate Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("instance", {
 *     description: "The default dnss",
 *     domain: "subdomain.hashicorptest.com",
 * });
 * const instance2 = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("instance2", {
 *     description: "The default dnss",
 *     domain: "subdomain2.hashicorptest.com",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.certificatemanager.Certificate("default", {
 *     description: "The default cert",
 *     scope: "EDGE_CACHE",
 *     managed: {
 *         domains: [
 *             instance.domain,
 *             instance2.domain,
 *         ],
 *         dnsAuthorizations: [
 *             instance.id,
 *             instance2.id,
 *         ],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Certificate can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/certificate:Certificate default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/certificates/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/certificate:Certificate default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/certificate:Certificate default {{name}}
 * ```
