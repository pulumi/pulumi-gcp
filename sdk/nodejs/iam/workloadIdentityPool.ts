/**
 * Represents a collection of external workload identities. You can define IAM policies to
 * grant these identities access to Google Cloud resources.
 *
 * To get more information about WorkloadIdentityPool, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Managing workload identity pools](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#pools)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Iam Workload Identity Pool Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.iam.WorkloadIdentityPool("example", {workloadIdentityPoolId: "example-pool"}, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Iam Workload Identity Pool Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.iam.WorkloadIdentityPool("example", {
 *     workloadIdentityPoolId: "example-pool",
 *     displayName: "Name of pool",
 *     description: "Identity pool for automated test",
 *     disabled: true,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * WorkloadIdentityPool can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default {{project}}/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default {{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
