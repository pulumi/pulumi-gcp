/**
 * Represents a collection of external workforces. Provides namespaces for
 * federated users that can be referenced in IAM policies.
 *
 * To get more information about WorkforcePool, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Manage pools](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#manage_pools)
 *
 * > **Note:** Ask your Google Cloud account team to request access to workforce identity federation for
 * your billing/quota project. The account team notifies you when the project is granted access.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Iam Workforce Pool Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.iam.WorkforcePool("example", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     workforcePoolId: "example-pool",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Iam Workforce Pool Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.iam.WorkforcePool("example", {
 *     description: "A sample workforce pool.",
 *     disabled: false,
 *     displayName: "Display name",
 *     location: "global",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     sessionDuration: "7200s",
 *     workforcePoolId: "example-pool",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * WorkforcePool can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workforcePool:WorkforcePool default locations/{{location}}/workforcePools/{{workforce_pool_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workforcePool:WorkforcePool default {{location}}/{{workforce_pool_id}}
 * ```
