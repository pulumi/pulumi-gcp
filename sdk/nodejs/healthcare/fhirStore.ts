/**
 * A FhirStore is a datastore inside a Healthcare dataset that conforms to the FHIR (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/)
 * standard for Healthcare information exchange
 *
 * To get more information about FhirStore, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating a FHIR store](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Healthcare Fhir Store Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const topic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("topic", {});
 * const dataset = new gcp.healthcare.Dataset("dataset", {location: "us-central1"});
 * const _default = new gcp.healthcare.FhirStore("default", {
 *     dataset: dataset.id,
 *     version: "R4",
 *     enableUpdateCreate: false,
 *     disableReferentialIntegrity: false,
 *     disableResourceVersioning: false,
 *     enableHistoryImport: false,
 *     notification_config: {
 *         pubsubTopic: topic.id,
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         label1: "labelvalue1",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Healthcare Fhir Store Streaming Config
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const dataset = new gcp.healthcare.Dataset("dataset", {location: "us-central1"});
 * const bqDataset = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("bqDataset", {
 *     datasetId: "bq_example_dataset",
 *     friendlyName: "test",
 *     description: "This is a test description",
 *     location: "US",
 *     deleteContentsOnDestroy: true,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.healthcare.FhirStore("default", {
 *     dataset: dataset.id,
 *     version: "R4",
 *     enableUpdateCreate: false,
 *     disableReferentialIntegrity: false,
 *     disableResourceVersioning: false,
 *     enableHistoryImport: false,
 *     labels: {
 *         label1: "labelvalue1",
 *     },
 *     stream_configs: [{
 *         resourceTypes: ["Observation"],
 *         bigquery_destination: {
 *             datasetUri: pulumi.interpolate`bq://${bqDataset.project}.${bqDataset.datasetId}`,
 *             schema_config: {
 *                 recursiveStructureDepth: 3,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * const topic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("topic", {});
 * ```
