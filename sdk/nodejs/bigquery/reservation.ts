/**
 * A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee BigQuery slots to users.
 *
 * To get more information about Reservation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rest/v1/projects.locations.reservations/create)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Bigquery Reservation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const reservation = new gcp.bigquery.Reservation("reservation", {
 *     concurrency: 0,
 *     ignoreIdleSlots: false,
 *     location: "asia-northeast1",
 *     // Set to 0 for testing purposes
 *     // In reality this would be larger than zero
 *     slotCapacity: 0,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
