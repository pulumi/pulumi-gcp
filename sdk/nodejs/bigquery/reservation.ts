 * A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee BigQuery slots to users.
 *
 * To get more information about Reservation, see:

 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
 *
 * ## Example Usage - Bigquery Reservation Basic
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const reservation = new gcp.bigquery.Reservation("reservation", {
 *     location: "asia-northeast1",
 *     slotCapacity: 0,
 *     ignoreIdleSlots: false,
 * });
