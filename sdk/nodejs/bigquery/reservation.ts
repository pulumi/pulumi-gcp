/**
 * A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee BigQuery slots to users.
 *
 * To get more information about Reservation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rest/v1/projects.locations.reservations/create)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Bigquery Reservation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const reservation = new gcp.bigquery.Reservation("reservation", {
 *     name: "my-reservation",
 *     location: "us-west2",
 *     slotCapacity: 0,
 *     edition: "STANDARD",
 *     ignoreIdleSlots: true,
 *     concurrency: 0,
 *     autoscale: {
 *         maxSlots: 100,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Reservation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```

     * for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the maxSlots - baseline.
     * This field must be set together with the scalingMode enum value, otherwise the request
     * will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
     * If the maxSlots and scalingMode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field
     * must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code

     * output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots
     * will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example,
     * if the maxSlots is 1000 and scalingMode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the
     * autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value
     * between 0 and 1000.
     * If the maxSlots is 1000, scalingMode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots
     * usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the
     * autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700.
     * If the maxSlots is 1000, scalingMode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the
     * autoscaler field will be null.
     * If the maxSlots and scalingMode are set, then the ignoreIdleSlots field must be
     * aligned with the scalingMode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments).
     * Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
     * Please note, the maxSlots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the
     * baseline. Therefore, we don't allow users to set maxSlots smaller or equal to the
     * baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and
     * slotCapacity>=maxSlots, requests will be rejected with error code
     * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
     * Please note that if maxSlots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set
     * maxSlots to 0 and set scalingMode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the maxSlots
     * feature.

     * `AUTOSCALE_ONLY`: The reservation will scale up only using slots from autoscaling. It will
     * not use any idle slots even if there may be some available. The upper limit that autoscaling
     * can scale up to will be maxSlots - baseline. For example, if maxSlots is 1000, baseline is 200

     * and no idle slots will be used. Please note, in this mode, the ignoreIdleSlots field must be
     * set to true. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code
     * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
     * `IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY`: The reservation will scale up using only idle slots contributed by other
     * reservations or from unassigned commitments. If no idle slots are available it will not scale
     * up further. If the idle slots which it is using are reclaimed by the contributing reservation(s)
     * it may be forced to scale down. The max idle slots the reservation can be maxSlots - baseline

     * Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT
     * `ALL_SLOTS`: The reservation will scale up using all slots available to it. It will use idle slots
     * contributed by other reservations or from unassigned commitments first. If no idle slots are
     * available it will scale up using autoscaling. For example, if maxSlots is 1000, baseline is 200
     * and customer sets ScalingMode to ALL_SLOTS, 1. if there are 800 idle slots available in other
     * reservations, the reservation will scale up to 1000 slots with 200 baseline and 800 idle slots. 2.
     * if there are 500 idle slots available in other reservations, the reservation will scale up to 1000
     * slots with 200 baseline, 500 idle slots and 300 autoscaling slots. 3. if there are no idle slots
     * available in other reservations, it will scale up to 1000 slots with 200 baseline and 800
     * autoscaling slots. Please note, in this mode, the ignoreIdleSlots field must be set to false.
