 * Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
 * it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
 * `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.
 * 
 * > **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, the
 * dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
 * `ignoreChanges = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.
 * 
 * 
 * To get more information about DatasetAccess, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets)
