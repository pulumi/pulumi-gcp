/**
 * Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
 * it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
 * `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.
 *
 * > **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, the
 * dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
 * `ignoreChanges = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.
 * Additionally, both resource cannot be modified in the same apply.
 *
 * To get more information about DatasetAccess, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Controlling access to datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-access-controls)
 *
 * > **Warning:** You must specify the role field using the legacy format `OWNER` instead of `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`.
 * The API does accept both formats but it will always return the legacy format which results in Terraform
 * showing permanent diff on each plan and apply operation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Bigquery Dataset Access Basic User
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const dataset = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("dataset", {datasetId: "example_dataset"});
 * const bqowner = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("bqowner", {accountId: "bqowner"});
 * const access = new gcp.bigquery.DatasetAccess("access", {
 *     datasetId: dataset.datasetId,
 *     role: "OWNER",
 *     userByEmail: bqowner.email,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Bigquery Dataset Access View
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _private = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("private", {datasetId: "example_dataset"});
 * const _public = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("public", {datasetId: "example_dataset2"});
 * const publicTable = new gcp.bigquery.Table("public", {

 *     tableId: "example_table",
 *     view: {
 *         query: "SELECT state FROM [lookerdata:cdc.project_tycho_reports]",
 *         useLegacySql: false,
 *     },
 * });
 * const access = new gcp.bigquery.DatasetAccess("access", {
 *     datasetId: _private.datasetId,
 *     view: {
 *         projectId: publicTable.project,
 *         datasetId: _public.datasetId,
 *         tableId: publicTable.tableId,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Bigquery Dataset Access Authorized Dataset

 *
 * const _private = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("private", {datasetId: "private"});
 * const _public = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("public", {datasetId: "public"});
 * const access = new gcp.bigquery.DatasetAccess("access", {
 *     datasetId: _private.datasetId,
 *     authorizedDataset: {
 *         dataset: {

 *         },
 *         targetTypes: ["VIEWS"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Bigquery Dataset Access Authorized Routine
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _public = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("public", {
 *     datasetId: "public_dataset",

 *     routineId: "public_routine",
 *     routineType: "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION",
 *     language: "SQL",
 *     definitionBody: "SELECT 1 + value AS value\n",
 *     arguments: [{
 *         name: "value",

 *         dataType: JSON.stringify({

 *         columns: [{
 *             name: "value",
 *             type: {
 *                 typeKind: "INT64",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *     }),
 * });
 * const _private = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("private", {
 *     datasetId: "private_dataset",
 *     description: "This dataset is private",
 * });
 * const authorizedRoutine = new gcp.bigquery.DatasetAccess("authorized_routine", {
 *     datasetId: _private.datasetId,
 *     routine: {
 *         projectId: publicRoutine.project,
 *         datasetId: publicRoutine.datasetId,
