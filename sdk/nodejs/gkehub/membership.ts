/**
 * Membership contains information about a member cluster.
 *
 * To get more information about Membership, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.memberships)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Registering a Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster#register_cluster)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Gkehub Membership Regional
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.container.Cluster("primary", {
 *     name: "basic-cluster",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     initialNodeCount: 1,
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 *     network: "default",
 *     subnetwork: "default",
 * });
 * const membership = new gcp.gkehub.Membership("membership", {
 *     membershipId: "basic",
 *     location: "us-west1",
 *     endpoint: {
 *         gkeCluster: {
 *             resourceLink: pulumi.interpolate`//container.googleapis.com/${primary.id}`,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Gkehub Membership Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.container.Cluster("primary", {
 *     name: "basic-cluster",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     initialNodeCount: 1,
 *     deletionProtection: true,
 *     network: "default",
 *     subnetwork: "default",
 * });
 * const membership = new gcp.gkehub.Membership("membership", {
 *     membershipId: "basic",
 *     endpoint: {
 *         gkeCluster: {
 *             resourceLink: pulumi.interpolate`//container.googleapis.com/${primary.id}`,
 *         },
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         env: "test",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Gkehub Membership Issuer
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.container.Cluster("primary", {
 *     name: "basic-cluster",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     initialNodeCount: 1,
 *     workloadIdentityConfig: {
 *         workloadPool: "my-project-name.svc.id.goog",
 *     },
 *     deletionProtection: true,
 *     network: "default",
 *     subnetwork: "default",
 * });
 * const membership = new gcp.gkehub.Membership("membership", {
 *     membershipId: "basic",
 *     endpoint: {
 *         gkeCluster: {
 *             resourceLink: primary.id,
 *         },
 *     },
 *     authority: {
 *         issuer: pulumi.interpolate`https://container.googleapis.com/v1/${primary.id}`,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Membership can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{membership_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Membership can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkehub/membership:Membership default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkehub/membership:Membership default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gkehub/membership:Membership default {{location}}/{{membership_id}}
 * ```
