/**
 * Retrieves the details of a specific GKE Hub Membership Binding. Use this data source to retrieve the membership binding's configuration and state.
 *
 * A membership binding associates a GKE Hub membership with a scope, enabling the membership to participate in fleet-wide configurations and policies defined by the scope.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = gcp.gkehub.getMembershipBinding({
 *     location: "global",
 *     membershipId: "my-membership-id",
 *     membershipBindingId: "my-membership-binding-id",
 *     project: "my-project-id",
 * });
 * ```
