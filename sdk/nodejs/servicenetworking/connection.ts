/**
 * Manages a private VPC connection with a GCP service provider. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#creating-connection)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/reference/rest/v1/services.connections).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Create a VPC network
 * const peeringNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("peering_network", {name: "peering-network"});
 * // Create an IP address
 * const privateIpAlloc = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("private_ip_alloc", {
 *     name: "private-ip-alloc",
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 16,
 *     network: peeringNetwork.id,
 * });
 * // Create a private connection
 * const _default = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("default", {
 *     network: peeringNetwork.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [privateIpAlloc.name],
 * });
 * // (Optional) Import or export custom routes
 * const peeringRoutes = new gcp.compute.NetworkPeeringRoutesConfig("peering_routes", {
 *     peering: _default.peering,
 *     network: peeringNetwork.name,
 *     importCustomRoutes: true,
 *     exportCustomRoutes: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ServiceNetworkingConnection can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * * `{{peering-network}}:{{service}}`
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{peering-network}}:{{service}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, NAME_HERE can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:servicenetworking/connection:Connection default {{peering-network}}:{{service}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:servicenetworking/connection:Connection default /projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{peering-network}}:{{service}}
 * ```
