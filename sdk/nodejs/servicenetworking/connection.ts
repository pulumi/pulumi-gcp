 * Manages a private VPC connection with a GCP service provider. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#creating-connection)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/reference/rest/v1/services.connections).

 * ## Example usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const peeringNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("peeringNetwork", {});
 * const privateIpAlloc = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("privateIpAlloc", {
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     network: peeringNetwork.selfLink,
 *     prefixLength: 16,
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 * });
 * const foobar = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("foobar", {
 *     network: peeringNetwork.selfLink,
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [privateIpAlloc.name],
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 * });
