 * A version to be propagated and deployed to Units. It points to a specific version of a Blueprint that can be applied to Units, for example, via a Rollout.

 * > **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
 * See Provider Versions for more details on beta resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Saas Runtime Release Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleSaas = new gcp.saasruntime.SaaS("example_saas", {
 *     saasId: "example-saas",
 *     location: "global",
 *     locations: [{
 *         name: "us-central1",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleUnitkind = new gcp.saasruntime.UnitKind("example_unitkind", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     unitKindId: "example-unitkind",
 *     saas: exampleSaas.id,
 * });
 * const examplePrevious = new gcp.saasruntime.Release("example_previous", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     releaseId: "previous-release",
 *     unitKind: exampleUnitkind.id,
 *     blueprint: {
 *         "package": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ci-test-project-188019/test-repo/tf-test-easysaas-alpha-image@sha256:7992fdbaeaf998ecd31a7f937bb26e38a781ecf49b24857a6176c1e9bfc299ee",
 *     },
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.saasruntime.Release("example", {
 *     location: "global",
 *     releaseId: "example-release",
 *     unitKind: exampleUnitkind.id,
 *     blueprint: {
 *         "package": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ci-test-project-188019/test-repo/tf-test-easysaas-beta-image@sha256:7bba0fa85b2956df7768f7b32e715b6fe11f4f4193e2a70a35bf3f286a6cdf9e",
 *     },
 *     inputVariableDefaults: [{
 *         variable: "name",
 *         value: "test",
 *         type: "STRING",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Release can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/releases/{{release_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{release_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{release_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Release can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/release:Release default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/releases/{{release_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/release:Release default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{release_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/release:Release default {{location}}/{{release_id}}
 * ```
