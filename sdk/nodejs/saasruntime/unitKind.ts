/**
 * A UnitKind serves as a template or type definition for a group of Units. Units that belong to the same UnitKind are managed together, follow the same release model, and are typically updated together through rollouts.
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
 * See Provider Versions for more details on beta resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Saas Runtime Unit Kind Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const exampleSaas = new gcp.saasruntime.SaaS("example_saas", {
 *     saasId: "example-saas",
 *     location: "us-east1",
 *     locations: [{
 *         name: "us-east1",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const clusterUnitKind = new gcp.saasruntime.UnitKind("cluster_unit_kind", {
 *     location: "us-east1",
 *     unitKindId: "cluster-unitkind",
 *     saas: exampleSaas.id,
 *     defaultRelease: "projects/my-project-name/locations/us-east1/releases/example-release",
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.saasruntime.UnitKind("example", {
 *     location: "us-east1",
 *     unitKindId: "app-unitkind",
 *     saas: exampleSaas.id,
 *     dependencies: [{
 *         unitKind: clusterUnitKind.id,
 *         alias: "cluster",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleRelease = new gcp.saasruntime.Release("example_release", {
 *     location: "us-east1",
 *     releaseId: "example-release",
 *     unitKind: clusterUnitKind.id,
 *     blueprint: {
 *         "package": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ci-test-project-188019/test-repo/tf-test-easysaas-alpha-image@sha256:7992fdbaeaf998ecd31a7f937bb26e38a781ecf49b24857a6176c1e9bfc299ee",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * UnitKind can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/unitKinds/{{unit_kind_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{unit_kind_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{unit_kind_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, UnitKind can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/unitKind:UnitKind default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/unitKinds/{{unit_kind_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/unitKind:UnitKind default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{unit_kind_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/unitKind:UnitKind default {{location}}/{{unit_kind_id}}
 * ```
