/**
 * A Saas resource is the top-level representation of a SaaS service managed by a producer. It contains a list of locations where the service is available, which is used by the Rollout system to generate a rollout plan.
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
 * See Provider Versions for more details on beta resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Saas Runtime Saas Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.saasruntime.SaaS("example", {
 *     saasId: "test-saas",
 *     location: "global",
 *     locations: [
 *         {
 *             name: "us-central1",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "europe-west1",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Saas can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/saas/{{saas_id}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{saas_id}}`
 * * `{{location}}/{{saas_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Saas can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/saaS:SaaS default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/saas/{{saas_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/saaS:SaaS default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{saas_id}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/saaS:SaaS default {{location}}/{{saas_id}}
 * ```
