 *
 * > **Note**
 *   Cloud Composer 1 is in the post-maintenance mode. Google does
 *   not release any further updates to Cloud Composer 1, including new versions
 *   of Airflow, bugfixes, and security updates. We recommend using
 *   Cloud Composer 2 or Cloud Composer 3 instead.
 *
 * Several special considerations apply to managing Cloud Composer environments
 * with Terraform:
 *
 * * The Environment resource is based on several layers of GCP infrastructure.
 *     Terraform does not manage these underlying resources. For example, in Cloud
 *     Composer 2, this includes a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud Storage, and
 *     Compute networking resources.
 * * Creating or updating an environment usually takes around 25 minutes.
 * * In some cases errors in the configuration will be detected and reported only
 *     during the process of the environment creation. If you encounter such
 *     errors, please verify your configuration is valid against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs for the Terraform provider.
 * * **Environments have Google Cloud Storage buckets that are not automatically
 *     deleted** with the environment.
 *     See [Delete environments](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/delete-environments)
 *     for more information.
 * * Please refer to
 *     [Troubleshooting pages](https://cloud.devsite.corp.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/troubleshooting-environment-creation) if you encounter
 *     problems.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Usage (Cloud Composer 3)
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = new gcp.composer.Environment("test", {
 *     name: "example-composer-env",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         softwareConfig: {
 *             imageVersion: "composer-3-airflow-2",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Basic Usage (Cloud Composer 2)
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = new gcp.composer.Environment("test", {
 *     name: "example-composer-env",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         softwareConfig: {
 *             imageVersion: "composer-2-airflow-2",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Basic Usage (Cloud Composer 1)
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = new gcp.composer.Environment("test", {
 *     name: "example-composer-env",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         softwareConfig: {
 *             imageVersion: "composer-1-airflow-2",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### With GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies
 *
 * > **Note**
 *   To use custom service accounts, you must give at least the
 *   `role/composer.worker` role to the service account of the Cloud Composer
 *   environment. For more information, see the
 *   [Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/access-control)
 *   page in the Cloud Composer documentation.
 *   You might need to assign additional roles depending on specific workflows
 *   that the Airflow DAGs will be running.
 *
 * ### GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies (Cloud Composer 3)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

 * ### GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies (Cloud Composer 1)
 *

 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const testNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("test", {
 *     name: "composer-test-network",

 *
 * ### Cloud Composer 3 networking configuration
 *
 * In Cloud Composer 3, networking configuration is simplified compared to
 * previous versions. You don't need to specify network ranges, and can attach
 * custom VPC networks to your environment.
 *
 * > **Note**
 *   It's not possible to detach a VPC network using Terraform. Instead, you can
 *   attach a different VPC network in its place, or detach the network using
 *   other tools like Google Cloud CLI.
 *
 * Use Private IP networking:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.composer.Environment("example", {
 *     name: "example-environment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         enablePrivateEnvironment: true,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Attach a custom VPC network (Cloud Composer creates a new network attachment):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.composer.Environment("example", {
 *     name: "example-environment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         nodeConfig: {
 *             network: "projects/example-project/global/networks/example-network",
 *             subnetwork: "projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/example-subnetwork",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Attach a custom VPC network (use existing network attachment):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.composer.Environment("example", {
 *     name: "example-environment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         nodeConfig: {
 *             composerNetworkAttachment: projects / example_project / regions / us_central1 / networkAttachments / example_network_attachment,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If you specify an existing network attachment that you also manage in Terraform, then Terraform will revert changes
 * to the attachment done by Cloud Composer when you apply configuration changes. As a result, the environment will no
 * longer use the attachment. To address this problem, make sure that Terraform ignores changes to the
 * `producerAcceptLists` parameter of the attachment, as follows:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.compute.NetworkAttachment("example", {});
 * const exampleEnvironment = new gcp.composer.Environment("example", {
 *     name: "example-environment",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         nodeConfig: {
 *             composerNetworkAttachment: example.id,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
