/**
 * The RuleDeployment resource represents the deployment state of a Rule.
 *
 * To get more information about RuleDeployment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/rest/v1/RuleDeployment)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Google SecOps Guides](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/secops/secops-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RuleDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RuleDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:chronicle/ruleDeployment:RuleDeployment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:chronicle/ruleDeployment:RuleDeployment default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:chronicle/ruleDeployment:RuleDeployment default {{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}
 * ```
