/**
 * Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
 * the IAM policy for an existing Google Cloud Platform folder.
 * 
 * > **Note:** This resource _must not_ be used in conjunction with
 *    `google_folder_iam_policy` or they will fight over what your policy
 *    should be. Similarly, roles controlled by `google_folder_iam_binding`
 *    should not be assigned to using `google_folder_iam_member`.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const department1 = new gcp.organizations.Folder("department1", {
 *     displayName: "Department 1",
 *     parent: "organizations/1234567",
 * });
 * const admin = new gcp.folder.IAMMember("admin", {
 *     folder: department1.name,
 *     member: "user:alice@gmail.com",
 *     role: "roles/editor",
 * });
 * ```
