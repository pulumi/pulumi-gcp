/**
 * Access Approval enables you to require your explicit approval whenever Google support and engineering need to access your customer content.
 *
 * To get more information about FolderSettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/reference/rest/v1/folders)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Folder Access Approval Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myFolder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("my_folder", {
 *     displayName: "folder-faaf",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const folderAccessApproval = new gcp.folder.AccessApprovalSettings("folder_access_approval", {
 *     folderId: myFolder.folderId,
 *     notificationEmails: [
 *         "testuser@example.com",
 *         "example.user@example.com",
 *     ],
 *     enrolledServices: [{
 *         cloudProduct: "all",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Folder Access Approval Active Key Version
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myFolder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("my_folder", {
 *     displayName: "folder-faak",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const myProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project", {
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 *     folderId: myFolder.name,
 *     deletionPolicy: "DELETE",
 * });
 * const keyRing = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("key_ring", {
 *     name: "key-ring",
 *     location: "global",
 *     project: myProject.projectId,
 * });
 * const cryptoKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("crypto_key", {
 *     name: "crypto-key",
 *     keyRing: keyRing.id,
 *     purpose: "ASYMMETRIC_SIGN",
 *     versionTemplate: {
 *         algorithm: "EC_SIGN_P384_SHA384",
 *     },
 * });
 * const serviceAccount = gcp.accessapproval.getFolderServiceAccountOutput({
 *     folderId: myFolder.folderId,
 * });
 * const iam = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMMember("iam", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: cryptoKey.id,
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier",
 *     member: serviceAccount.apply(serviceAccount => `serviceAccount:${serviceAccount.accountEmail}`),
 * });
 * const cryptoKeyVersion = gcp.kms.getKMSCryptoKeyVersionOutput({
 *     cryptoKey: cryptoKey.id,
 * });
 * const folderAccessApproval = new gcp.folder.AccessApprovalSettings("folder_access_approval", {
 *     folderId: myFolder.folderId,
 *     activeKeyVersion: cryptoKeyVersion.apply(cryptoKeyVersion => cryptoKeyVersion.name),
 *     enrolledServices: [{
 *         cloudProduct: "all",
 *     }],
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [iam],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FolderSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder_id}}/accessApprovalSettings`
 * * `{{folder_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FolderSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:folder/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default folders/{{folder_id}}/accessApprovalSettings
 * $ pulumi import gcp:folder/accessApprovalSettings:AccessApprovalSettings default {{folder_id}}
 * ```
