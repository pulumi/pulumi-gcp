/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a folder. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the folder and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the folder are preserved.
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the folder are preserved.
 * * `gcp.folder.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.folder.IAMBinding`, `gcp.folder.IAMMember`, or `gcp.folder.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.folder.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.folder.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * > **Note:** The underlying API method `projects.setIamPolicy` has constraints which are documented [here](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy). In addition to these constraints,
 *    IAM Conditions cannot be used with Basic Roles such as Owner. Violating these constraints will result in the API returning a 400 error code so please review these if you encounter errors with this resource.
 *
 * ## gcp.folder.IAMPolicy
 *
 * !> **Be careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your folder
 *    using this resource. Deleting a `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` removes access
 *    from anyone without permissions on its parent folder/organization. Proceed with caution.
 *    It's not recommended to use `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` with your provider folder
 *    to avoid locking yourself out, and it should generally only be used with folders
 *    fully managed by Terraform. If you do use this resource, it is recommended to **import** the policy before
 *    applying the change.
