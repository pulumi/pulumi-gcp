/**
 * Get OpenID userinfo about the credentials used with the Google provider,
 * specifically the email.
 * 
 * When the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` scope is enabled in
 * your provider block, this datasource enables you to export the email of the
 * account you've authenticated the provider with; this can be used alongside
 * `data.google_client_config`'s `access_token` to perform OpenID Connect
 * authentication with GKE and configure an RBAC role for the email used.
 * 
 * > This resource will only work as expected if the provider is configured to
 * use the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` scope! You will
 * receive an error otherwise.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage - exporting an email
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * const me = pulumi.output(gcp.organizations.getClientOpenIdUserInfo({}));
 * 
 * export const my_email = me.email;
 * ```
