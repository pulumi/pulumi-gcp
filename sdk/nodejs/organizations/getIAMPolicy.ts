/**
 * Generates an IAM policy document that may be referenced by and applied to
 * other Google Cloud Platform IAM resources, such as the `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` resource.
 *
 * **Note:** Please review the documentation of the resource that you will be using the datasource with. Some resources such as `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` and others have limitations in their API methods which are noted on their respective page.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const admin = pulumi.output(gcp.organizations.getIAMPolicy({
 *     auditConfigs: [{
 *         auditLogConfigs: [
 *             {
 *                 exemptedMembers: ["user:you@domain.com"],
 *                 logType: "DATA_READ",
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 logType: "DATA_WRITE",
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 logType: "ADMIN_READ",
 *             },
 *         ],
 *         service: "cloudkms.googleapis.com",
 *     }],
 *     bindings: [
 *         {
 *             members: ["serviceAccount:your-custom-sa@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"],
 *             role: "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             members: ["user:alice@gmail.com"],
 *             role: "roles/storage.objectViewer",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * }));
 * ```
 *
 * This data source is used to define IAM policies to apply to other resources.
 * Currently, defining a policy through a datasource and referencing that policy
 * from another resource is the only way to apply an IAM policy to a resource.
