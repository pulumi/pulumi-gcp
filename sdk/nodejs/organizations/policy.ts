/**
 * Allows management of Organization Policies for a Google Cloud Organization.
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource has been superseded by `gcp.orgpolicy.Policy`. `gcp.orgpolicy.Policy` uses Organization Policy API V2 instead of Cloud Resource Manager API V1 and it supports additional features such as tags and conditions.
 *
 * To get more information about Organization Policies, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/organizations/setOrgPolicy)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Introduction to the Organization Policy Service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * To set policy with a [boolean constraint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/quickstart-boolean-constraints):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const serialPortPolicy = new gcp.organizations.Policy("serial_port_policy", {
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     constraint: "compute.disableSerialPortAccess",
 *     booleanPolicy: {
 *         enforced: true,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To set a policy with a [list constraint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/quickstart-list-constraints):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.organizations.Policy("services_policy", {
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     listPolicy: {
 *         allow: {
 *             all: true,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Or to deny some services, use the following instead:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.organizations.Policy("services_policy", {
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     listPolicy: {
 *         suggestedValue: "compute.googleapis.com",
 *         deny: {
 *             values: ["cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To restore the default organization policy, use the following instead:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.organizations.Policy("services_policy", {
 *     orgId: "123456789",
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     restorePolicy: {
 *         "default": true,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Organization Policies can be imported using the `org_id` and the `constraint`, e.g.
 *
 * * `{{org_id}}/constraints/{{constraint}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Organization Policies can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/policy:Policy default {{org_id}}/constraints/{{constraint}}
 * ```
 *
 * It is all right if the constraint contains a slash, as in the example above.
