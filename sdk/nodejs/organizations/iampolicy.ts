/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a organization. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the organization and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`, `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`, or `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy
 *
 * !> **Warning:** New organizations have several default policies which will,
 *    without extreme caution, be **overwritten** by use of this resource.
 *    The safest alternative is to use multiple `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`
 *    resources. This resource makes it easy to remove your own access to
 *    an organization, which will require a call to Google Support to have
 *    fixed, and can take multiple days to resolve.
 *
 *    In general, this resource should only be used with organizations
 *    fully managed by this provider.I f you do use this resource,
 *    the best way to be sure that you are not making dangerous changes is to start
 *    by **importing** your existing policy, and examining the diff very closely.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ### Importing Audit Configs
 *
 * An audit config can be imported into a `google_organization_iam_audit_config` resource using the resource's `org_id` and the `service`, e.g:
 *
 * * `"{{org_id}} foo.googleapis.com"`
 *
 * An `import` block (Terraform v1.5.0 and later) can be used to import audit configs:
 *
 * tf
 *
 * import {
 *
 *   id = "{{org_id}} foo.googleapis.com"
 *
 *   to = google_organization_iam_audit_config.default
 *
 * }
 *
 * The `pulumi import` command can also be used:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy default "{{org_id}} foo.googleapis.com"
 * ```
