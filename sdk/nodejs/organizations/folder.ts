/**
 * Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see 
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)
 * and 
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).
 * 
 * A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.
 * 
 * Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
 * 
 * The service account used to run this provider when creating a `google_folder`
 * resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator`. See the
 * [Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
 * doc for more information.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * 
 * // Top-level folder under an organization.
 * const department1 = new gcp.organizations.Folder("department1", {
 *     displayName: "Department 1",
 *     parent: "organizations/1234567",
 * });
 * // Folder nested under another folder.
 * const team_abc = new gcp.organizations.Folder("team-abc", {
 *     displayName: "Team ABC",
 *     parent: department1.name,
 * });
 * ```
