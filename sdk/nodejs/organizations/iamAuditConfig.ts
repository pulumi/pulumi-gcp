/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a organization. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the organization and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`, `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`, or `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy
 *
 * !> **Warning:** New organizations have several default policies which will,
 *    without extreme caution, be **overwritten** by use of this resource.
 *    The safest alternative is to use multiple `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`
 *    resources. This resource makes it easy to remove your own access to
 *    an organization, which will require a call to Google Support to have
 *    fixed, and can take multiple days to resolve.
 *    <br /><br />
 *    In general, this resource should only be used with organizations
 *    fully managed by Terraform.If you do use this resource,
 *    the best way to be sure that you are not making dangerous changes is to start
 *    by **importing** your existing policy, and examining the diff very closely.
 *
