/**
 * Allows creation and management of a Google Cloud Platform project.
 *
 * Projects created with this resource must be associated with an Organization.
 * See the [Organization documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
 *
 * The user or service account that is running this provider when creating a `gcp.organizations.Project`
 * resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the specified organization. See the
 * [Access Control for Organizations Using IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org)
 * doc for more information.
 *
 * > This resource reads the specified billing account on every pulumi up and plan operation so you must have permissions on the specified billing account.
 *
 * > It is recommended to use the `constraints/compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation` [constraint](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_organization_policy.html) to remove the default network instead of setting `autoCreateNetwork` to false, when possible.
 *
 * > It may take a while for the attached tag bindings to be deleted after the project is scheduled to be deleted.
 *
 * To get more information about projects, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating and managing projects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project", {
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 *     orgId: "1234567",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To create a project under a specific folder
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const department1 = new gcp.organizations.Folder("department1", {
 *     displayName: "Department 1",
 *     parent: "organizations/1234567",
 * });
 * const myProject_in_a_folder = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project-in-a-folder", {
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 *     folderId: department1.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To create a project with a tag
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("my_project", {
 *     name: "My Project",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 *     orgId: "1234567",
 *     tags: {
 *         "1234567/env": "staging",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Projects can be imported using the `project_id`, e.g.
 *
 * * `{{project_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Projects can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/project:Project default {{project_id}}
 * ```
