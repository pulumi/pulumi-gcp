/**
 * Storage Batch Operations (SBO) is a Cloud Storage management feature that offers a
 * seamless experience to perform single batch operations on millions of GCS objects in a
 * serverless manner.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Storage Batch Operations
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket", {
 *     name: "tf-sample-bucket",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 * });
 * const tf_job = new gcp.storage.BatchOperationsJob("tf-job", {
 *     jobId: "tf-job",
 *     bucketList: {
 *         buckets: {
 *             bucket: bucket.name,
 *             prefixList: {
 *                 includedObjectPrefixes: ["bkt"],
 *             },
 *         },
 *     },
 *     putMetadata: {
 *         customMetadata: {
 *             key: "value",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     deleteProtection: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Job can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/jobs/{{job_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{job_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{job_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Job can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:storage/batchOperationsJob:BatchOperationsJob default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/jobs/{{job_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:storage/batchOperationsJob:BatchOperationsJob default {{project}}/{{job_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:storage/batchOperationsJob:BatchOperationsJob default {{job_id}}
 * ```
