/**
 * A Google Cloud Storage Managed Folder.
 *
 * You can apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to
 * managed folders to grant principals access only to the objects
 * within the managed folder, which lets you more finely control access
 * for specific data sets and tables within a bucket. You can nest
 * managed folders up to 15 levels deep, including the parent managed
 * folder.
 *
 * Managed folders can only be created in buckets that have uniform
 * bucket-level access enabled.
 *
 * To get more information about ManagedFolder, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/managedFolder)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managed-folders)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Storage Managed Folder Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket", {
 *     name: "my-bucket",
 *     location: "EU",
 *     uniformBucketLevelAccess: true,
 * });
 * const folder = new gcp.storage.ManagedFolder("folder", {
 *     bucket: bucket.name,
 *     name: "managed/folder/name/",
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ManagedFolder can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `{{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{name}}`
 * * `{{bucket}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ManagedFolder can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:storage/managedFolder:ManagedFolder default {{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:storage/managedFolder:ManagedFolder default {{bucket}}/{{name}}
 * ```
