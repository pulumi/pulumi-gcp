/**
 * The Google Cloud storage signed URL data source generates a signed URL for a given storage object. Signed URLs provide a way to give time-limited read or write access to anyone in possession of the URL, regardless of whether they have a Google account.
 *
 * For more info about signed URL's is available [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const artifact = gcp.storage.getObjectSignedUrl({
 *     bucket: "install_binaries",
 *     path: "path/to/install_file.bin",
 * });
 * const vm = new gcp.compute.Instance("vm", {name: "vm"});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Full Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as std from "@pulumi/std";
 *
 * const getUrl = std.file({
 *     input: "path/to/credentials.json",
 * }).then(invoke => gcp.storage.getObjectSignedUrl({
 *     bucket: "fried_chicken",
 *     path: "path/to/file",
 *     contentMd5: "pRviqwS4c4OTJRTe03FD1w==",
 *     contentType: "text/plain",
 *     duration: "2d",
 *     credentials: invoke.result,
 *     extensionHeaders: {
 *         "x-goog-if-generation-match": "1",
 *     },
 * }));
 * ```
