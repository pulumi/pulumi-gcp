/**
 * Get the email address of a project's unique Google Cloud Storage service account.
 *
 * Each Google Cloud project has a unique service account for use with Google Cloud Storage. Only this
 * special service account can be used to set up `gcp.storage.Notification` resources.
 *
 * For more information see
 * [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gcsAccount = gcp.storage.getProjectServiceAccount({});
 * const binding = new gcp.pubsub.TopicIAMBinding("binding", {
 *     topic: google_pubsub_topic.topic.name,
 *     role: "roles/pubsub.publisher",
 *     members: [gcsAccount.then(gcsAccount => `serviceAccount:${gcsAccount.emailAddress}`)],
 * });
 * ```
