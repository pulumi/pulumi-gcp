/**
 * Get the email address of a project's unique [automatic Google Cloud Storage service account](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts).
 *
 * For each Google Cloud project, Google maintains a unique service account which
 * is used as the identity for various Google Cloud Storage operations, including
 * operations involving
 * [customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys)
 * and those involving
 * [storage notifications to pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/notification).
 * This automatic Google service account requires access to the relevant Cloud KMS keys or pub/sub topics, respectively, in order for Cloud Storage to use
 * these customer-managed resources.
 *
 * The service account has a well-known, documented naming format which is parameterised on the numeric Google project ID.
 * However, as noted in [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts), it is only created when certain relevant actions occur which
 * presuppose its existence.
 * These actions include calling a [Cloud Storage API endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount/get) to yield the
 * service account's identity, or performing some operations in the UI which must use the service account's identity, such as attempting to list Cloud KMS keys
 * on the bucket creation page.
 *
 * Use of this data source calls the relevant API endpoint to obtain the service account's identity and thus ensures it exists prior to any API operations
 * which demand its existence, such as specifying it in Cloud IAM policy.
 * Always prefer to use this data source over interpolating the project ID into the well-known format for this service account, as the latter approach may cause
 * provider update errors in cases where the service account does not yet exist.
 *
 * >  When you write provider code which uses features depending on this service account *and* your provider code adds the service account in IAM policy on other resources,
 *    you must take care for race conditions between the establishment of the IAM policy and creation of the relevant Cloud Storage resource.
 *    Cloud Storage APIs will require permissions on resources such as pub/sub topics or Cloud KMS keys to exist *before* the attempt to utilise them in a
 *    bucket configuration, otherwise the API calls will fail.
 *    You may need to use `dependsOn` to create an explicit dependency between the IAM policy resource and the Cloud Storage resource which depends on it.
 *    See the examples here and in the `gcp.storage.Notification` resource.
 *
 * For more information see
 * [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Pub/Sub Notifications
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gcsAccount = gcp.storage.getProjectServiceAccount({});
 * const binding = new gcp.pubsub.TopicIAMBinding("binding", {
 *     topic: topic.name,
 *     role: "roles/pubsub.publisher",
 *     members: [gcsAccount.then(gcsAccount => `serviceAccount:${gcsAccount.emailAddress}`)],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Cloud KMS Keys
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gcsAccount = gcp.storage.getProjectServiceAccount({});
 * const binding = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMBinding("binding", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: "your-crypto-key-id",
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter",
 *     members: [gcsAccount.then(gcsAccount => `serviceAccount:${gcsAccount.emailAddress}`)],
 * });
 * const bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket", {
 *     name: "kms-protected-bucket",
 *     location: "US",
 *     encryption: {
 *         defaultKmsKeyName: "your-crypto-key-id",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [binding],
 * });
 * ```
