/**
 * A Cloud Spanner Database which is hosted on a Spanner instance.
 *
 * To get more information about Database, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.instances.databases)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/)
 *
 * > **Warning:** On newer versions of the provider, you must explicitly set `deletion_protection=false`
 * (and run `pulumi up` to write the field to state) in order to destroy an instance.
 * It is recommended to not set this field (or set it to true) until you're ready to destroy.
 * On older versions, it is strongly recommended to set `lifecycle { preventDestroy = true }`
 * on databases in order to prevent accidental data loss. See
 * Terraform docs
 * for more information on lifecycle parameters.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Spanner Database Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const main = new gcp.spanner.Instance("main", {
 *     config: "regional-europe-west1",
 *     displayName: "main-instance",
 *     numNodes: 1,
 * });
 * const database = new gcp.spanner.Database("database", {
 *     instance: main.name,
 *     name: "my-database",
 *     versionRetentionPeriod: "3d",
 *     defaultTimeZone: "UTC",
 *     ddls: [
 *         "CREATE TABLE t1 (t1 INT64 NOT NULL,) PRIMARY KEY(t1)",
 *         "CREATE TABLE t2 (t2 INT64 NOT NULL,) PRIMARY KEY(t2)",
 *     ],
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Database can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/instances/{{instance}}/databases/{{name}}`
 * * `instances/{{instance}}/databases/{{name}}`
 * * `{{project}}/{{instance}}/{{name}}`
 * * `{{instance}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Database can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/database:Database default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{instance}}/databases/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/database:Database default instances/{{instance}}/databases/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/database:Database default {{project}}/{{instance}}/{{name}}
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/database:Database default {{instance}}/{{name}}
 * ```
