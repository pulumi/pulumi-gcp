 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner database. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the database and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 *
 * > **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your database using `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMPolicy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the database are preserved.
 * * `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the database are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMBinding` and `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.DatabaseIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
