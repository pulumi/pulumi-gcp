/**
 * Get the DNSKEY and DS records of DNSSEC-signed managed zones.
 *
 * For more information see the
 * [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/dnskeys/)
 * and [API](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/reference/v1/dnsKeys).
 *
 * > A gcp.dns.ManagedZone resource must have DNSSEC enabled in order
 * to contain any DNSKEYs. Queries to managed zones without this setting
 * enabled will result in a 404 error as the collection of DNSKEYs does
 * not exist in the DNS API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foo = new gcp.dns.ManagedZone("foo", {
 *     name: "foobar",
 *     dnsName: "foo.bar.",
 *     dnssecConfig: {
 *         state: "on",
 *         nonExistence: "nsec3",
 *     },
 * });
 * const fooDnsKeys = gcp.dns.getKeysOutput({
 *     managedZone: foo.id,
 * });
 * export const fooDnsDsRecord = fooDnsKeys.apply(fooDnsKeys => fooDnsKeys.keySigningKeys?.[0]?.dsRecord);
 * ```
