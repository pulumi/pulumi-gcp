/**
 * Get the DNSKEY and DS records of DNSSEC-signed managed zones. For more information see the
 * [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/dnskeys/)
 * and [API](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/reference/v1/dnsKeys).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foo = new gcp.dns.ManagedZone("foo", {
 *     dnsName: "foo.bar.",
 *     dnssec_config: {
 *         state: "on",
 *         nonExistence: "nsec3",
 *     },
 * });
 * const fooDnsKeys = foo.id.apply(id => gcp.dns.getKeys({
 *     managedZone: id,
 * }));
 * export const fooDnsDsRecord = fooDnsKeys.keySigningKeys[0].dsRecord;
 * ```
