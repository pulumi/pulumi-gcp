        ### Importing Audit Configs

        An audit config can be imported into a `google_project_iam_audit_config` resource using the resource's `project_id` and the `service`, e.g:

        * `"{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"`

        An `import` block (Terraform v1.5.0 and later) can be used to import audit configs:

        tf

        import {

          id = "{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"

          to = google_project_iam_audit_config.default

        }

        The `pulumi import` command can also be used:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy default "{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] policy_data: The `organizations_get_iam_policy` data source that represents
               the IAM policy that will be applied to the project. The policy will be
               merged with any existing policy applied to the project.
               
               Changing this updates the policy.
               
               Deleting this removes all policies from the project, locking out users without
               organization-level access.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] project: The project id of the target project. This is not
               inferred from the provider.

        ## projects.IAMPolicy

        !> **Be careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your project
           using this resource. Deleting a `projects.IAMPolicy` removes access
           from anyone without organization-level access to the project. Proceed with caution.
           It's not recommended to use `projects.IAMPolicy` with your provider project
           to avoid locking yourself out, and it should generally only be used with projects
           fully managed by this provider. If you do use this resource, it is recommended to **import** the policy before
           applying the change.

        ## Import

        ### Importing Audit Configs

        An audit config can be imported into a `google_project_iam_audit_config` resource using the resource's `project_id` and the `service`, e.g:

        * `"{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"`

        An `import` block (Terraform v1.5.0 and later) can be used to import audit configs:

        tf

        import {

          id = "{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"

          to = google_project_iam_audit_config.default

        }

        The `pulumi import` command can also be used:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:projects/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy default "{{project_id}} foo.googleapis.com"
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
