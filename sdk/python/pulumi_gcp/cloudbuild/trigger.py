    A build resource in the Container Builder API.

    level, a `build` describes where to find source code, how to build it (for
    example, the builder image to run on the source), and where to store
    the built artifacts. Fields can include the following variables, which
    will be expanded when the build is created:
    * `$PROJECT_ID`: the project ID of the build.
    * `$BUILD_ID`: the autogenerated ID of the build.
    * `$REPO_NAME`: the source repository name specified by RepoSource.
    * `$BRANCH_NAME`: the branch name specified by RepoSource.
    * `$TAG_NAME`: the tag name specified by RepoSource.
