    basic: pulumi.Output[dict]
    """
    A set of predefined conditions for the access level and a combining function.  Structure is documented below.

      * `combiningFunction` (`str`) - How the conditions list should be combined to determine if a request
        is granted this AccessLevel. If AND is used, each Condition in
        conditions must be satisfied for the AccessLevel to be applied. If
        OR is used, at least one Condition in conditions must be satisfied
        for the AccessLevel to be applied.
      * `conditions` (`list`) - A set of requirements for the AccessLevel to be granted.  Structure is documented below.
        * `devicePolicy` (`dict`) - Device specific restrictions, all restrictions must hold for
          the Condition to be true. If not specified, all devices are
          allowed.  Structure is documented below.
          * `allowedDeviceManagementLevels` (`list`) - A list of allowed device management levels.
            An empty list allows all management levels.
          * `allowedEncryptionStatuses` (`list`) - A list of allowed encryptions statuses.
            An empty list allows all statuses.
          * `osConstraints` (`list`) - A list of allowed OS versions.
            An empty list allows all types and all versions.  Structure is documented below.
            * `minimumVersion` (`str`) - The minimum allowed OS version. If not set, any version
              of this OS satisfies the constraint.
              Format: "major.minor.patch" such as "10.5.301", "9.2.1".
            * `osType` (`str`) - The operating system type of the device.

          * `requireAdminApproval` (`bool`) - Whether the device needs to be approved by the customer admin.
          * `requireCorpOwned` (`bool`) - Whether the device needs to be corp owned.
          * `requireScreenLock` (`bool`) - Whether or not screenlock is required for the DevicePolicy
            to be true. Defaults to false.

        * `ipSubnetworks` (`list`) - A list of CIDR block IP subnetwork specification. May be IPv4
          or IPv6.
          Note that for a CIDR IP address block, the specified IP address
          portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must
          be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example,
          "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly,
          for IPv6, "2001:db8::/32" is accepted whereas "2001:db8::1/32"
          is not. The originating IP of a request must be in one of the
          listed subnets in order for this Condition to be true.
          If empty, all IP addresses are allowed.
        * `members` (`list`) - An allowed list of members (users, service accounts).
          Using groups is not supported yet.
          The signed-in user originating the request must be a part of one
          of the provided members. If not specified, a request may come
          from any user (logged in/not logged in, not present in any
          groups, etc.).
          Formats: `user:{emailid}`, `serviceAccount:{emailid}`
        * `negate` (`bool`) - Whether to negate the Condition. If true, the Condition becomes
          a NAND over its non-empty fields, each field must be false for
          the Condition overall to be satisfied. Defaults to false.
        * `regions` (`list`) - The request must originate from one of the provided
          countries/regions.
          Format: A valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
        * `requiredAccessLevels` (`list`) - A list of other access levels defined in the same Policy,
          referenced by resource name. Referencing an AccessLevel which
          does not exist is an error. All access levels listed must be
          granted for the Condition to be true.
