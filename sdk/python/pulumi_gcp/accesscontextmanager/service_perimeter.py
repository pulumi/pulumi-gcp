        ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
        and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
        ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
        has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
        Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
        - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
        GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
        Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP

            syntax error. If no AccessLevel names are listed, resources within
            the perimeter can only be accessed via GCP calls with request
            origins within the perimeter. For Service Perimeter Bridge, must
            be empty.

          * `resources` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of GCP resources that are inside of the service perimeter.
            Currently only projects are allowed.
            Format: projects/{project_number}
          * `restrictedServices` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
            restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
            `storage.googleapis.com` is specified, access to the storage
            buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
            restrictions.
          * `vpcAccessibleServices` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Specifies how APIs are allowed to communicate within the Service
            Perimeter.  Structure is documented below.
            * `allowedServices` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of APIs usable within the Service Perimeter.
              Must be empty unless `enableRestriction` is True.
            * `enableRestriction` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether to restrict API calls within the Service Perimeter to the
              list of APIs specified in 'allowedServices'.

        The **status** object supports the following:

          * `accessLevels` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of AccessLevel resource names that allow resources within
            the ServicePerimeter to be accessed from the internet.
