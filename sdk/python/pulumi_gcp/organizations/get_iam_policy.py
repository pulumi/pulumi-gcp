    This data source is used to define IAM policies to apply to other resources.
    Currently, defining a policy through a datasource and referencing that policy
    from another resource is the only way to apply an IAM policy to a resource.
    
    **Note:** Several restrictions apply when setting IAM policies through this API.
    See the [setIamPolicy docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy)
    for a list of these restrictions.
