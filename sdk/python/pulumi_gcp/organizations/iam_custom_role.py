        > **Warning:** Note that custom roles in GCP have the concept of a soft-delete. There are two issues that may arise
         from this and how roles are propagated. 1) creating a role may involve undeleting and then updating a role with the
         same name, possibly causing confusing behavior between undelete and update. 2) A deleted role is permanently deleted
         after 7 days, but it can take up to 30 more days (i.e. between 7 and 37 days after deletion) before the role name is
         made available again. This means a deleted role that has been deleted for more than 7 days cannot be changed at all
         by Terraform, and new roles cannot share that name.
