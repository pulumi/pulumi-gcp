        Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see 
        [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)
        and 
        [API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).
        
        A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.
        
        Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
        
        The service account used to run Terraform when creating a `google_folder`
        resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator`. See the
        [Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
        doc for more information.
