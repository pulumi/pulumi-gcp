            If the network that the instance is being created in is a Legacy network, then the IP address is allocated from the IPv4Range.
            If the network that the instance is being created in is an auto Subnet Mode Network, then only network name should be specified (not the subnetworkName) and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork that exists in that zone for that network.
            If the network that the instance is being created in is a custom Subnet Mode Network, then the subnetworkName must be specified and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork.
            If specified, the subnetwork must exist in the same region as the App Engine flexible environment application.

        The **readiness_check** object supports the following:

          * `appStartTimeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - A maximum time limit on application initialization, measured from moment the application successfully
            replies to a healthcheck until it is ready to serve traffic. Default: "300s"
          * `checkInterval` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Interval between health checks.
          * `failureThreshold` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of consecutive failed checks required before considering the VM unhealthy. Default: 4.
          * `host` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Host header to send when performing a HTTP Readiness check. Example: "myapp.appspot.com"
          * `path` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The request path.
          * `successThreshold` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of consecutive successful checks required before considering the VM healthy. Default: 2.
          * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Time before the check is considered failed. Default: "4s"

        The **resources** object supports the following:

          * `cpu` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of CPU cores needed.
          * `diskGb` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Disk size (GB) needed.
          * `memoryGb` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Memory (GB) needed.
          * `volumes` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - List of ports, or port pairs, to forward from the virtual machine to the application container.  Structure is documented below.
            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Full Serverless VPC Access Connector name e.g. /projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/connectors/c1.
            * `sizeGb` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Volume size in gigabytes.
            * `volumeType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Underlying volume type, e.g. 'tmpfs'.

        The **vpc_access_connector** object supports the following:

          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Full Serverless VPC Access Connector name e.g. /projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/connectors/c1.
