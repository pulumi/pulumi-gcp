            If the network that the instance is being created in is an auto Subnet Mode Network, then only network name should be specified (not the subnetworkName) and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork that exists in that zone for that network.
            If the network that the instance is being created in is a custom Subnet Mode Network, then the subnetworkName must be specified and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork.

            If the network that the instance is being created in is an auto Subnet Mode Network, then only network name should be specified (not the subnetworkName) and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork that exists in that zone for that network.
            If the network that the instance is being created in is a custom Subnet Mode Network, then the subnetworkName must be specified and the IP address is created from the IPCidrRange of the subnetwork.
