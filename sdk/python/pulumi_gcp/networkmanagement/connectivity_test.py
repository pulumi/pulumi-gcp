        A connectivity test are a static analysis of your resource configurations
        that enables you to evaluate connectivity to and from Google Cloud
        resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

        To get more information about ConnectivityTest, see:

        ## Example Usage

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: The user-supplied description of the Connectivity Test.
               Maximum of 512 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['ConnectivityTestDestinationArgs']] destination: Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
               You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
               Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
               destination location.
               Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
               location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
               endpoint from route information.
               If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
               multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
               destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
               interface.
               A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
               is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
               don't intend to test.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Unique name for the connectivity test.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: IP Protocol of the test. When not provided, "TCP" is assumed.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] related_projects: Other projects that may be relevant for reachability analysis.
               This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
               boundaries.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['ConnectivityTestSourceArgs']] source: Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
               You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
               (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
               source location.
               Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
               a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
               also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
               which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
               information.
               If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
               you must provide the destination VPC network.
               If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
               network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
               identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
               address or VPC network.
               A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
               ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
               you don't intend to test.
               Structure is documented below.
