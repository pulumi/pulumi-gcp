               good_service is defined based off the count of these time windows
               for which the provided service was of good quality.
               A SLI describes a good service. It is used to measure and calculate
               the quality of the Service's performance with respect to a single
               aspect of service quality.
               Exactly one of the following must be set:
               `basic_sli`, `request_based_sli`, `windows_based_sli`  Structure is documented below.

        The **basic_sli** object supports the following:

          * `latency` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Parameters for a latency threshold SLI.  Structure is documented below.
            * `threshold` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - A duration string, e.g. 10s.
              Good service is defined to be the count of requests made to
              this service that return in no more than threshold.

          * `locations` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - An optional set of locations to which this SLI is relevant.
            Telemetry from other locations will not be used to calculate
            performance for this SLI. If omitted, this SLI applies to all
            locations in which the Service has activity. For service types
            that don't support breaking down by location, setting this
            field will result in an error.
          * `methods` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - An optional set of RPCs to which this SLI is relevant.
            Telemetry from other methods will not be used to calculate
            performance for this SLI. If omitted, this SLI applies to all
            the Service's methods. For service types that don't support
            breaking down by method, setting this field will result in an
            error.
          * `versions` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The set of API versions to which this SLI is relevant.
            Telemetry from other API versions will not be used to
            calculate performance for this SLI. If omitted,
