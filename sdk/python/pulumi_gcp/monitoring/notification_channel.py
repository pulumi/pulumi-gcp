        A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
        when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
        and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
        like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

        Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
        and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
        present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
        present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
        Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
        and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
        labels are required.

        A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
        accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
        This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
