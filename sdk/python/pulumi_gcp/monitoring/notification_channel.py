        A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
        when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
        and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
        like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

        Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
        and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
        present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
        present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
        Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
        and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
        labels are required.

        A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
        accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
        This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.

        ## Example Usage

        ### Notification Channel Basic

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        basic = gcp.monitoring.NotificationChannel("basic",
            display_name="Test Notification Channel",
            type="email",
            labels={
                "email_address": "fake_email@blahblah.com",
            },
            force_delete=False)
        ```
        ### Notification Channel Sensitive

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        default = gcp.monitoring.NotificationChannel("default",
            display_name="Test Slack Channel",
            type="slack",
            labels={
                "channel_name": "#foobar",
            },
            sensitive_labels={
                "authToken": "one",
            })
        ```

        ## Import

        NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, NotificationChannel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/notificationChannel:NotificationChannel default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional human-readable description of this notification channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] display_name: An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enabled: Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] force_delete: If true, the notification channel will be deleted regardless
               of its use in alert policies (the policies will be updated
               to remove the channel). If false, channels that are still
               referenced by an existing alerting policy will fail to be
               deleted in a delete operation.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
               permissible and required labels are specified in the
               NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
               Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore the provider cannot
               determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
               the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['NotificationChannelSensitiveLabelsArgs', 'NotificationChannelSensitiveLabelsArgsDict']] sensitive_labels: Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the `labels` field on this
               resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
               sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
               in the `labels` map in the api request.
               Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
               to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.
               Structure is documented below.
