        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] host_state: The host state of your domain name. Host state is determined by checking each
               IP address associated with your domain name to see if it's serving
               Hosting content.
               HOST_UNHOSTED:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name isn't associated with any IP addresses.
               HOST_UNREACHABLE:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
               queries to find your domain name's IP addresses resulted in errors. See
               your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.
               HOST_MISMATCH:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that don't ultimately
               resolve to Hosting.
               HOST_CONFLICT:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that resolve to both
               Hosting and other services. To ensure consistent results, remove `A` and
               `AAAA` records related to non-Hosting services.
               HOST_ACTIVE:
               All requests against your `CustomDomain`'s domain name are served by
               Hosting. If the `CustomDomain`'s `OwnershipState` is also `ACTIVE`, Hosting
               serves your Hosting Site's content on the domain name.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['HostingCustomDomainIssueArgs']]] issues: A set of errors Hosting systems encountered when trying to establish
               Hosting's ability to serve secure content for your domain name. Resolve
               these issues to ensure your `CustomDomain` behaves properly.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: The fully-qualified name of the `CustomDomain`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] ownership_state: The ownership state of your domain name. Ownership is determined at a
               Firebase project level, and established by adding `TXT` records to your
               domain name's DNS records.
               Ownership cascades to subdomains. Granting a project ownership of `foo.com`
               also grants that project ownership over `bar.foo.com`, unless you add
               specific `TXT` records to `bar.foo.com` that grant a different project
               ownership.
               If your `CustomDomain` is in an `OwnershipState` other than
               `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE` for more than 30 days and it hasn't been updated in at
               least 30 days, Hosting's ownership systems delete the `CustomDomain`.
               OWNERSHIP_MISSING:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has no Hosting-related ownership records;
               no Firebase project has permission to act on the domain name's behalf.
               OWNERSHIP_UNREACHABLE:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
               queries to find your domain name's ownership records resulted in errors.
               See your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.
               OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name is owned by another Firebase project.
               Remove the conflicting `TXT` records and replace them with project-specific
               records for your current Firebase project.
               OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has conflicting `TXT` records that
               indicate ownership by both your current Firebase project and another
               project. Remove the other project's ownership records to grant the current
               project ownership.
               OWNERSHIP_PENDING:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s DNS records are configured correctly. Hosting will
               transfer ownership of your domain to this `CustomDomain` within 24 hours.
               OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE:
               Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has `TXT` records that grant its project
               permission to act on its behalf.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] reconciling: if true, indicates that Hosting's systems are attempting to
               make the `CustomDomain`'s state match your preferred state. This is most
               frequently `true` when initially provisioning a `CustomDomain` or when creating
               a new SSL certificate to match an updated `cert_preference`
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] redirect_target: A domain name that this CustomDomain should direct traffic towards. If

               Hosting and other services. To ensure consistent results, remove `A` and
               `AAAA` records related to non-Hosting services.
               HOST_ACTIVE:
               All requests against your `CustomDomain`'s domain name are served by
               Hosting. If the `CustomDomain`'s `OwnershipState` is also `ACTIVE`, Hosting

               Firebase project level, and established by adding `TXT` records to your
               domain name's DNS records.
               Ownership cascades to subdomains. Granting a project ownership of `foo.com`
               also grants that project ownership over `bar.foo.com`, unless you add
               specific `TXT` records to `bar.foo.com` that grant a different project
               ownership.

               `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE` for more than 30 days and it hasn't been updated in at
               least 30 days, Hosting's ownership systems delete the `CustomDomain`.

               records for your current Firebase project.
