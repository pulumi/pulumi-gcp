        A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using
        a configuration file



        > **Warning:** This resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
        and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in the provider as well
        will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
        fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
        experienced user of both tools.

        In addition, due to limitations of the API, the provider will treat
        deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
        than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
        `preview=false`).
