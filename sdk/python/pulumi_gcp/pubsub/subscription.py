    """
    This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge the
    message. After message delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an
    outstanding message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions,
    this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
    subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify
    is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a
    default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call
    to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the
    message.
    """
    expiration_policy: pulumi.Output[dict]

    A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long
    as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the
    subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. If it is set but ttl is

    How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
    retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how
    far back in time a subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days ('"604800s"') or less
