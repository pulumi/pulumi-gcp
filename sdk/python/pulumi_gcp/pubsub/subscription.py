        ## Example Usage
        ### Pubsub Subscription Push

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        example_topic = gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic")
        example_subscription = gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription",
            topic=example_topic.name,
            ack_deadline_seconds=20,
            labels={
                "foo": "bar",
            },
            push_config=gcp.pubsub.SubscriptionPushConfigArgs(
                push_endpoint="https://example.com/push",
                attributes={
                    "x-goog-version": "v1",

        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        example_topic = gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleTopic", project="topic-project")
        example_subscription = gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription",
            project="subscription-project",
            topic=example_topic.name)
        ```
        ### Pubsub Subscription Dead Letter

        ```python
        import pulumi

        example_dead_letter = gcp.pubsub.Topic("exampleDeadLetter")
        example_subscription = gcp.pubsub.Subscription("exampleSubscription",
            topic=example_topic.name,
            dead_letter_policy=gcp.pubsub.SubscriptionDeadLetterPolicyArgs(
                dead_letter_topic=example_dead_letter.id,
                max_delivery_attempts=10,
            ))
        ```

        ## Import

        Subscription can be imported using any of these accepted formats

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/subscription:Subscription default projects/{{project}}/subscriptions/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/subscription:Subscription default {{project}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/subscription:Subscription default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] ack_deadline_seconds: This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
               before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
               delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
               acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
               again during that time (on a best-effort basis).
               For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
               the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
               subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
               pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
               maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
               If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
               For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
               for the call to the push endpoint.
               If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
               will eventually redeliver the message.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubscriptionDeadLetterPolicyArgs']] dead_letter_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
               this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
               is disabled.
               The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
               parent project (i.e.,
               service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
               permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_message_ordering: If `true`, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
               the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
               may be delivered in any order.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubscriptionExpirationPolicyArgs']] expiration_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
               A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
               is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
               operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
               policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
               resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
               is 1 day.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] filter: The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
               Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
               by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
               you can't modify the filter.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] message_retention_duration: How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
               backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
               retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention
               of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
               subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
               than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`).
               A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
               by 's'. Example: `"600.5s"`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the subscription.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubscriptionPushConfigArgs']] push_config: If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
               configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
               pull and ack messages using API methods.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] retain_acked_messages: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then
               messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
               they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
               messageRetentionDuration window.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubscriptionRetryPolicyArgs']] retry_policy: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.
               If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
               RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] topic: A reference to a Topic resource.
