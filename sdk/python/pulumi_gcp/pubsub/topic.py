        ## Example Usage - Pubsub Topic Basic


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        example = gcp.pubsub.Topic("example", labels={
            "foo": "bar",

        ## Example Usage - Pubsub Topic Cmek


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        key_ring = gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyRing", location="global")

        example = gcp.pubsub.Topic("example", kms_key_name=crypto_key.id)
        ```
        ## Example Usage - Pubsub Topic Geo Restricted
