        Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for pubsub topic. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
        
        * `google_pubsub_topic_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the topic and replaces any existing policy already attached.
        * `google_pubsub_topic_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the topic are preserved.
        * `google_pubsub_topic_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the topic are preserved.

        > **Note:** `google_pubsub_topic_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_pubsub_topic_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
