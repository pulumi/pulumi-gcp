          and will have ephemeral external IP addresses assigned to each instance. If set to true, all
          instances in the cluster will only have internal IP addresses. Note: Private Google Access
          (also known as `privateIpGoogleAccess`) must be enabled on the subnetwork that the cluster
          will be launched in.
        * `metadata` (`dict`) - A map of the Compute Engine metadata entries to add to all instances

          specified. These can be	either FQDNs, or scope aliases. The following scopes
          must be set if any other scopes are set. They're necessary to ensure the
          correct functioning ofthe cluster, and are set automatically by the API:

          subnetwork the cluster will be part of. Conflicts with `network`.

          the master and the worker nodes will be created in). If `region` is set to 'global' (default)

          to determine this automatically for you.
          Note: This setting additionally determines and restricts
          which computing resources are available for use with other configs such as

          allowed to take to execute its action. GCP will default to a predetermined
          computed value if not set (currently 300).

              specified. These can be	either FQDNs, or scope aliases. The following scopes
              must be set if any other scopes are set. They're necessary to ensure the
              correct functioning ofthe cluster, and are set automatically by the API:
            * `subnetwork` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
              subnetwork the cluster will be part of. Conflicts with `network`.
            * `tags` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of instance tags applied to instances in the cluster.
              Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls.

              the master and the worker nodes will be created in). If `region` is set to 'global' (default)
              then `zone` is mandatory, otherwise GCP is able to make use of [Auto Zone Placement](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/auto-zone)
              to determine this automatically for you.
              Note: This setting additionally determines and restricts
              which computing resources are available for use with other configs such as
              `cluster_config.master_config.machine_type` and `cluster_config.worker_config.machine_type`.
