      * `instance` (`str`) - App instance.
        By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.

        By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.

        By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.

    """
    Rate limits for task dispatches.
    The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:
    * Number of tasks in the queue
    * User-specified throttling: rateLimits, retryConfig, and the queue's state.
    * System throttling due to 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service
    Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to
    smooth sudden large traffic spikes.  Structure is documented below.

      * `maxBurstSize` (`float`) - -
        The max burst size.
        Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
        in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
        rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
        resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
      * `maxConcurrentDispatches` (`float`) - The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
        be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
        reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
        concurrent requests decreases.
      * `maxDispatchesPerSecond` (`float`) - The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.
        If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
    """
    retry_config: pulumi.Output[dict]
    """
    Settings that determine the retry behavior.  Structure is documented below.

      * `maxAttempts` (`float`) - Number of attempts per task.
        Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
        the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
        retries). Must be >= -1.
        If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
        the default.
        -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
      * `maxBackoff` (`str`) - A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
        maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
        specifies that the task should be retried.
      * `maxDoublings` (`float`) - The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.
        A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
        then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
        up to maxAttempts times.
      * `maxRetryDuration` (`str`) - If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
        retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
        attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
        been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
        made and the task will be deleted.
        If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
