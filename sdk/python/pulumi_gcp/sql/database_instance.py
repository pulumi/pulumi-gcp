        > **NOTE on `sql.DatabaseInstance`:** - First-generation instances have been
        deprecated and should no longer be created, see [upgrade docs](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/upgrade-2nd-gen)

        To upgrade your First-generation instance, update your config that the instance has
        * `settings.ip_configuration.ipv4_enabled=true`
        * `settings.backup_configuration.enabled=true`
        * `settings.backup_configuration.binary_log_enabled=true`.  
        Apply the config, then upgrade the instance in the console as described in the documentation.
        Once upgraded, update the following attributes in your config to the correct value according to
        the above documentation:
        * `region`
        * `database_version` (if applicable)
        * `tier`

        * `settings.crash_safe_replication`
        * `settings.replication_type`
        * `settings.authorized_gae_applications`
        And change values to appropriate values for Second-generation instances for:
        * `activation_policy` ("ON_DEMAND" is no longer an option)
        * `pricing_plan` ("PER_USE" is now the only valid option)
        Change `settings.backup_configuration.enabled` attribute back to its desired value and apply as necessary.

        > **NOTE on `sql.DatabaseInstance`:** - Second-generation instances include a
        default 'root'@'%' user with no password. This user will be deleted by the provider on
        instance creation. You should use `sql.User` to define a custom user with
        a restricted host and strong password.
