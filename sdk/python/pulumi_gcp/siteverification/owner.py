        An owner is an additional user that may manage a verified web site in the
        [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/). There
        are two types of web resource owners:

        * Verified owners, which are added to a web resource automatically when it
            is created (i.e., when the resource is verified). A verified owner is
            determined by the identity of the user requesting verification.
        * Additional owners, which can be added to the resource by verified owners.

        `siteverification.Owner` creates additional owners. If your web site
        was verified using the
        `siteverification.WebResource`
        resource then you (or the identity was used to create the resource, such as a
        service account) are already an owner.

        > **Note:** The email address of the owner must belong to a Google account,
        such as a Gmail account, a Google Workspace account, or a GCP service account.

        Working with site verification requires the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/siteverification`
        authentication scope. See the
        Google Provider authentication documentation
        to learn how to configure additional scopes.

        To get more information about site owners, see:

        * [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1)
        * How-to Guides
            * [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1/getting_started)

        ## Example Usage

        ### Site Verification Storage Bucket

        This example uses the `FILE` verification method to verify ownership of web site hosted
        in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Ownership is proved by creating a file with a Google-provided
        value in a known location. The user applying this configuration will automatically be
        added as a verified owner, and the `siteverification.Owner` resource will add
        `user@example.com` as an additional owner.

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        bucket = gcp.storage.Bucket("bucket",
            name="example-storage-bucket",
            location="US")
        token = gcp.siteverification.get_token_output(type="SITE",
            identifier=bucket.name.apply(lambda name: f"https://{name}.storage.googleapis.com/"),
            verification_method="FILE")
        object = gcp.storage.BucketObject("object",
            name=token.token,
            content=token.apply(lambda token: f"google-site-verification: {token.token}"),
            bucket=bucket.name)
        public_rule = gcp.storage.ObjectAccessControl("public_rule",
            bucket=bucket.name,
            object=object.name,
            role="READER",
            entity="allUsers")
        example = gcp.siteverification.WebResource("example",
            site={
                "type": token.type,
                "identifier": token.identifier,
            },
            verification_method=token.verification_method)
        example_owner = gcp.siteverification.Owner("example",
            web_resource_id=example.id,
            email="user@example.com")
        ```

        ## Import

        Owner can be imported using this format:

        * `webResource/{{web_resource_id}}/{{email}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, Site owners can be imported using the format above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:siteverification/owner:Owner default webResource/{{web_resource_id}}/{{email}}
        ```

        verified owners is to delete the web resource itself.

        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] email: The email of the user to be added as an owner.
