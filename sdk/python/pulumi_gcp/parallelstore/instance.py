        ### Parallelstore Instance Basic

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        network = gcp.compute.Network("network",
            name="network",

        default = gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("default",
            network=network.id,

            description="test instance",
            capacity_gib="12000",
            network=network.name,

            opts = pulumi.ResourceOptions(depends_on=[default]))
        ```

        ## Import

        Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`

        * `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:parallelstore/instance:Instance default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
        ```
