        Creates a Google Bigtable instance. For more information see

        ## Example Usage

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['InstanceClusterArgs']]]] clusters: A block of cluster configuration options. This can be specified at least once, and up to 4 times.
               See structure below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] deletion_protection: Whether or not to allow this provider to destroy the instance. Unless this field is set to false
               in the statefile, a `pulumi destroy` or `pulumi up` that would delete the instance will fail.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] display_name: The human-readable display name of the Bigtable instance. Defaults to the instance `name`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] instance_type: The instance type to create. One of `"DEVELOPMENT"` or `"PRODUCTION"`. Defaults to `"PRODUCTION"`.
               It is recommended to leave this field unspecified since the distinction between `"DEVELOPMENT"` and `"PRODUCTION"` instances is going away,
               and all instances will become `"PRODUCTION"` instances. This means that new and existing `"DEVELOPMENT"` instances will be converted to
               `"PRODUCTION"` instances. It is recommended for users to use `"PRODUCTION"` instances in any case, since a 1-node `"PRODUCTION"` instance
               is functionally identical to a `"DEVELOPMENT"` instance, but without the accompanying restrictions.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the resource. Label keys must follow the requirements at https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name (also called Instance Id in the Cloud Console) of the Cloud Bigtable instance.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
