        # bigtable.Instance

        Creates a Google Bigtable instance. For more information see:

        * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/admin/rest/v2/projects.instances.clusters)
        * How-to Guides
            * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs)

        ## Example Usage

        ### Simple Instance

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        production_instance = gcp.bigtable.Instance("production-instance",
            name="tf-instance",
            clusters=[{
                "clusterId": "tf-instance-cluster",
                "numNodes": 1,
                "storageType": "HDD",
            }],
            labels={
                "my-label": "prod-label",
            })
        ```

        ### Replicated Instance

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        production_instance = gcp.bigtable.Instance("production-instance",
            name="tf-instance",
            clusters=[
                {
                    "clusterId": "tf-instance-cluster1",
                    "numNodes": 1,
                    "storageType": "HDD",
                    "zone": "us-central1-c",
                },
                {
                    "clusterId": "tf-instance-cluster2",
                    "storageType": "HDD",
                    "zone": "us-central1-b",
                    "autoscalingConfig": {
                        "minNodes": 1,
                        "maxNodes": 3,
                        "cpuTarget": 50,
                    },
                },
            ],
            labels={
                "my-label": "prod-label",
            })
        ```

        ## Import

        Bigtable Instances can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, Bigtable Instances can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['InstanceClusterArgs', 'InstanceClusterArgsDict']]]] clusters: A block of cluster configuration options. This can be specified at least once, and up 
               to as many as possible within 8 cloud regions. Removing the field entirely from the config will cause the provider
               to default to the backend value. See structure below.
               
               -----
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] deletion_protection: Whether or not to allow this provider to destroy the instance. Unless this field is set to false
               in the statefile, a `pulumi destroy` or `pulumi up` that would delete the instance will fail.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] display_name: The human-readable display name of the Bigtable instance. Defaults to the instance `name`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] force_destroy: Deleting a BigTable instance can be blocked if any backups are present in the instance. When `force_destroy` is set to true, the Provider will delete all backups found in the BigTable instance before attempting to delete the instance itself. Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] instance_type: The instance type to create. One of `"DEVELOPMENT"` or `"PRODUCTION"`. Defaults to `"PRODUCTION"`.
               It is recommended to leave this field unspecified since the distinction between `"DEVELOPMENT"` and `"PRODUCTION"` instances is going away,
               and all instances will become `"PRODUCTION"` instances. This means that new and existing `"DEVELOPMENT"` instances will be converted to
               `"PRODUCTION"` instances. It is recommended for users to use `"PRODUCTION"` instances in any case, since a 1-node `"PRODUCTION"` instance
               is functionally identical to a `"DEVELOPMENT"` instance, but without the accompanying restrictions.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the resource. Label keys must follow the requirements at https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements.
               
               **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name (also called Instance Id in the Cloud Console) of the Cloud Bigtable instance. Must be 6-33 characters and must only contain hyphens, lowercase letters and numbers.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
