class IAMPolicy(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity. This resource is to add iam policy bindings to a service account resource to configure permissions for who can edit the service account. To configure permissions for a service account to act as an identity that can manage other GCP resources, use the [google_project_iam](google_project_iam.html) set of resources.
    
    Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a service account. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    
    * `google_service_account_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service account and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    * `google_service_account_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service account are preserved.
    * `google_service_account_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the service account are preserved.
    
    ~> **Note:** `google_service_account_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `google_service_account_iam_binding` and `google_service_account_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    
    ~> **Note:** `google_service_account_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_service_account_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
