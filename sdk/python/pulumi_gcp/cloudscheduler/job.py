               cancelled and the attempt is marked as a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED failure. The failed attempt can be viewed in
               execution logs. Cloud Scheduler will retry the job according to the RetryConfig.
               The allowed duration for this deadline is:
               * For HTTP targets, between 15 seconds and 30 minutes.
               * For App Engine HTTP targets, between 15 seconds and 24 hours.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: A human-readable description for the job.
               This string must not contain more than 500 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] http_target: HTTP target.

               send a request to the targeted url  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the job.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] pubsub_target: Pub/Sub target
               If the job providers a Pub/Sub target the cron will publish
               a message to the provided topic  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: Region where the scheduler job resides
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] retry_config: By default, if a job does not complete successfully,
               meaning that an acknowledgement is not received from the handler,
               then it will be retried with exponential backoff according to the settings  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] schedule: Describes the schedule on which the job will be executed.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] time_zone: Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting schedule.

            A job's retry interval starts at minBackoffDuration,
            then doubles maxDoublings times, then increases linearly,
            and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoffDuration up to retryCount times.
          * `maxRetryDuration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from time when an execution was first attempted.
            If specified with retryCount, the job will be retried until both limits are reached.

          * `minBackoffDuration` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.
            A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
