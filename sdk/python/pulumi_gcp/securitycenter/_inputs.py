               Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have

               The supported operators are:
               * = for all value types.
               * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
               * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
               The supported value types are:
               * string literals in quotes.
               * integer literals without quotes.
