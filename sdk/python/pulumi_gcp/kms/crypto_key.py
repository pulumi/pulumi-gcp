    Allows creation of a Google Cloud Platform KMS CryptoKey. For more information see
    [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy#cryptokey)

    A CryptoKey is an interface to key material which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. A CryptoKey belongs to a
    Google Cloud KMS KeyRing.
    
    ~> Note: CryptoKeys cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform. Destroying a
    Terraform-managed CryptoKey will remove it from state and delete all
    CryptoKeyVersions, rendering the key unusable, but **will not delete the
    resource on the server**. When Terraform destroys these keys, any data
    previously encrypted with these keys will be irrecoverable. For this reason, it
    is strongly recommended that you add lifecycle hooks to the resource to prevent
    accidental destruction.
