class DatabaseIAMMember(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner database. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    
    * `google_spanner_database_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the database and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    
    ~> **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your database using `google_spanner_database_iam_policy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.
    
    * `google_spanner_database_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the database are preserved.
    * `google_spanner_database_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the database are preserved.
    
    ~> **Note:** `google_spanner_database_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `google_spanner_database_iam_binding` and `google_spanner_database_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    
    ~> **Note:** `google_spanner_database_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_spanner_database_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
