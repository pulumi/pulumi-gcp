        A Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language
        understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. Dialogflow translates end-user text or audio
        during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a Dialogflow
        agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.
