    """
    A Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the user.  Structure is documented below.

      * `delegationServiceAccountEmail` (`str`) - -
        This field will contain the service account email address that
        this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container
        Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account
        the IAM role needed to read attestations from the noteReference in
        Container Analysis (containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer).
        This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but
        callers should not make any other assumptions about the service
        account email; future versions may use an email based on a
        different naming pattern.
      * `noteReference` (`str`) - The resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the
        user. If the Note is in a different project from the Attestor, it
        should be specified in the format `projects/*/notes/*` (or the legacy
        `providers/*/notes/*`). This field may not be updated.
        An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Container Analysis
        ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image
        and that links to this Note.
      * `publicKeys` (`list`) - Public keys that verify attestations signed by this attestor. This
        field may be updated.
        If this field is non-empty, one of the specified public keys must
        verify that an attestation was signed by this attestor for the
        image specified in the admission request.
        If this field is empty, this attestor always returns that no valid
        attestations exist.  Structure is documented below.
        * `asciiArmoredPgpPublicKey` (`str`) - ASCII-armored representation of a PGP public key, as the
          entire output by the command
          `gpg --export --armor foo@example.com` (either LF or CRLF
          line endings). When using this field, id should be left
          blank. The BinAuthz API handlers will calculate the ID
          and fill it in automatically. BinAuthz computes this ID
          as the OpenPGP RFC4880 V4 fingerprint, represented as
          upper-case hex. If id is provided by the caller, it will
          be overwritten by the API-calculated ID.
        * `comment` (`str`) - A descriptive comment. This field may be updated.
        * `id` (`str`) - The ID of this public key. Signatures verified by BinAuthz
          must include the ID of the public key that can be used to
          verify them, and that ID must match the contents of this
          field exactly. Additional restrictions on this field can
          be imposed based on which public key type is encapsulated.
          See the documentation on publicKey cases below for details.
        * `pkixPublicKey` (`dict`) - A raw PKIX SubjectPublicKeyInfo format public key.
          NOTE: id may be explicitly provided by the caller when using this
          type of public key, but it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If id is left
          blank, a default one will be computed based on the digest of the DER
          encoding of the public key.  Structure is documented below.
          * `publicKeyPem` (`str`) - A PEM-encoded public key, as described in
            `https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-13`
          * `signatureAlgorithm` (`str`) - The signature algorithm used to verify a message against
            a signature using this key. These signature algorithm must
            match the structure and any object identifiers encoded in
            publicKeyPem (i.e. this algorithm must match that of the
            public key).
