    Get the email address of a project's unique [automatic Google Cloud Storage service account](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts).

    For each Google Cloud project, Google maintains a unique service account which
    is used as the identity for various Google Cloud Storage operations, including
    operations involving
    [customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys)
    and those involving
    [storage notifications to pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/notification).
    This automatic Google service account requires access to the relevant Cloud KMS keys or pub/sub topics, respectively, in order for Cloud Storage to use
    these customer-managed resources.

    The service account has a well-known, documented naming format which is parameterised on the numeric Google project ID.
    However, as noted in [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts), it is only created when certain relevant actions occur which
    presuppose its existence.
    These actions include calling a [Cloud Storage API endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount/get) to yield the
    service account's identity, or performing some operations in the UI which must use the service account's identity, such as attempting to list Cloud KMS keys
    on the bucket creation page.

    Use of this data source calls the relevant API endpoint to obtain the service account's identity and thus ensures it exists prior to any API operations
    which demand its existence, such as specifying it in Cloud IAM policy.
    Always prefer to use this data source over interpolating the project ID into the well-known format for this service account, as the latter approach may cause
    provider update errors in cases where the service account does not yet exist.

    >  When you write provider code which uses features depending on this service account *and* your provider code adds the service account in IAM policy on other resources,
       you must take care for race conditions between the establishment of the IAM policy and creation of the relevant Cloud Storage resource.
       Cloud Storage APIs will require permissions on resources such as pub/sub topics or Cloud KMS keys to exist *before* the attempt to utilise them in a
       bucket configuration, otherwise the API calls will fail.
       You may need to use `depends_on` to create an explicit dependency between the IAM policy resource and the Cloud Storage resource which depends on it.
       See the examples here and in the `storage.Notification` resource.

    For more information see
    [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount).
