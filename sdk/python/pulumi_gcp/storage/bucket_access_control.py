        Bucket ACLs can be managed authoritatively using the
        `storage_bucket_acl` resource. Do not use these two resources in conjunction to manage the same bucket.

        The BucketAccessControls resource manages the Access Control List
        (ACLs) for a single entity/role pairing on a bucket. ACLs let you specify who
        has access to your data and to what extent.

        There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:

        READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
        list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
        objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
        WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
        and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
        information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
        READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.
