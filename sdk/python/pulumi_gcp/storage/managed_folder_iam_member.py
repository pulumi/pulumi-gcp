        ```

        ## Import

        For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

        * b/{{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{managed_folder}}

        * {{bucket}}/{{managed_folder}}

        Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.

        Cloud Storage managedfolder IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.

        IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:storage/managedFolderIamMember:ManagedFolderIamMember editor "b/{{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{managed_folder}} roles/storage.objectViewer user:jane@example.com"
        ```

        IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:storage/managedFolderIamMember:ManagedFolderIamMember editor "b/{{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{managed_folder}} roles/storage.objectViewer"
        ```

        IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:storage/managedFolderIamMember:ManagedFolderIamMember editor b/{{bucket}}/managedFolders/{{managed_folder}}
        ```

        -> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the

         full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] bucket: The name of the bucket that contains the managed folder. Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['ManagedFolderIamMemberConditionArgs', 'ManagedFolderIamMemberConditionArgsDict']] condition: An [IAM Condition](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview) for a given binding.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] managed_folder: Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to
        :param pulumi.Input[str] member: Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
               Each entry can have one of the following values:
               * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
               * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
               * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
               * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
               * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
               * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.
               * **projectOwner:projectid**: Owners of the given project. For example, "projectOwner:my-example-project"
               * **projectEditor:projectid**: Editors of the given project. For example, "projectEditor:my-example-project"
               * **projectViewer:projectid**: Viewers of the given project. For example, "projectViewer:my-example-project"
        :param pulumi.Input[str] role: The role that should be applied. Only one
               `storage.ManagedFolderIamBinding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
               `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.
