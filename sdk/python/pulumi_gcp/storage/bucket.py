            * `withState` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Match to live and/or archived objects. Unversioned buckets have only live objects. Supported values include: `"LIVE"`, `"ARCHIVED"`, `"ANY"`.

        The **logging** object supports the following:

          * `logBucket` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The bucket that will receive log objects.
          * `logObjectPrefix` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The object prefix for log objects. If it's not provided,
            by default GCS sets this to this bucket's name.

        The **retention_policy** object supports the following:

          * `isLocked` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If set to `true`, the bucket will be [locked](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-bucket-lock#lock-bucket) and permanently restrict edits to the bucket's retention policy.  Caution: Locking a bucket is an irreversible action.
          * `retentionPeriod` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The period of time, in seconds, that objects in the bucket must be retained and cannot be deleted, overwritten, or archived. The value must be less than 3,155,760,000 seconds.

        The **versioning** object supports the following:

          * `enabled` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - While set to `true`, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket.

        The **website** object supports the following:

          * `mainPageSuffix` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Behaves as the bucket's directory index where
            missing objects are treated as potential directories.
          * `notFoundPage` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The custom object to return when a requested
            resource is not found.
