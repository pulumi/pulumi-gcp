          value in your config.
        * `min_cpu_platform` (`str`) - Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance.
          The instance may be scheduled on the specified or newer CPU platform. Applicable

          to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
          However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
          as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause the provider to
          recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
          Kubernetes (eg. through `kubectl`), and it's recommended that you do not use
          this field to manage taints. If you do, `lifecycle.ignore_changes` is
          recommended. Structure is documented below.
          * `effect` (`str`) - Effect for taint. Accepted values are `NO_SCHEDULE`, `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`, and `NO_EXECUTE`.

               Whether Intra-node visibility is enabled for this cluster. This makes same node pod to pod traffic visible for VPC network.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_kubernetes_alpha: Whether to enable Kubernetes Alpha features for
               this cluster. Note that when this option is enabled, the cluster cannot be upgraded
               and will be automatically deleted after 30 days.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_legacy_abac: Whether the ABAC authorizer is enabled for this cluster.
               When enabled, identities in the system, including service accounts, nodes, and controllers,
               will have statically granted permissions beyond those provided by the RBAC configuration or IAM.
               Defaults to `false`
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_shielded_nodes: Enable Shielded Nodes features on all nodes in this cluster.  Defaults to `false`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_tpu: Whether to enable Cloud TPU resources in this cluster.
               See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup).
        :param pulumi.Input[float] initial_node_count: The number of nodes to create in this
               cluster's default node pool. In regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the
               number of nodes per zone. Must be set if `node_pool` is not set. If you're using
               `container.NodePool` objects with no default node pool, you'll need to
               set this to a value of at least `1`, alongside setting
               `remove_default_node_pool` to `true`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] ip_allocation_policy: Configuration of cluster IP allocation for
               VPC-native clusters. Adding this block enables [IP aliasing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases),
               making the cluster VPC-native instead of routes-based. Structure is documented
               below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] location: The location (region or zone) in which the cluster
               master will be created, as well as the default node location. If you specify a
               zone (such as `us-central1-a`), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a
               single cluster master. If you specify a region (such as `us-west1`), the
               cluster will be a regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in
               the region, and with default node locations in those zones as well
        :param pulumi.Input[str] logging_service: The logging service that the cluster should
               write logs to. Available options include `logging.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver),
               `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Logging), and `none`. Defaults to `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] maintenance_policy: The maintenance policy to use for the cluster. Structure is
               documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] master_auth: The authentication information for accessing the
               Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
               your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
               you see an unexpected diff removing a username/password or unsetting your client
               cert, ensure you have the `container.clusters.getCredentials` permission.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] master_authorized_networks_config: The desired configuration options
               for master authorized networks. Omit the nested `cidr_blocks` attribute to disallow
               external access (except the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] min_master_version: The minimum version of the master. GKE
               will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
               current master version--use the read-only `master_version` field to obtain that.
               If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
               official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
               the `container.getEngineVersions` data source useful - it indicates which versions
               are available. If you intend to specify versions manually,
               [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#specifying_cluster_version)
               describe the various acceptable formats for this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] monitoring_service: The monitoring service that the cluster
               should write metrics to.
               Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
               VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
               Available options include
               `monitoring.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver), `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and `none`.
               Defaults to `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the cluster, unique within the project and
               location.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
               network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the
               shared network.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] network_policy: Configuration options for the
               [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/networkpolicies/)
               feature. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] node_config: Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
               Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
               `container.NodePool` or a `node_pool` block; this configuration
               manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] node_locations: The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
               are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
               same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
               a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] node_pools: List of node pools associated with this cluster.
               See container.NodePool for schema.
               **Warning:** node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
               cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
               to say "these are the _only_ node pools associated with this cluster", use the
               container.NodePool resource instead of this property.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] node_version: The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
               or set to the same value as `min_master_version` on create. Defaults to the default
               version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
               nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
               recommended that you specify explicit versions as the provider will see spurious diffs
               when fuzzy versions are used. See the `container.getEngineVersions` data source's
               `version_prefix` field to approximate fuzzy versions.
               To update nodes in other node pools, use the `version` attribute on the node pool.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] pod_security_policy_config: Configuration for the
               [PodSecurityPolicy](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies) feature.

               clusters with private nodes. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] release_channel: Configuration options for the [Release channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels)
               feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
               When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
               [Migrating between release channels](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#migrating_between_release_channels)
               for more details; the `container.getEngineVersions` datasource can provide
               the default version for a channel. Note that removing the `release_channel`
               field from your config will cause this provider to stop managing your cluster's
               release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the `"UNSPECIFIED"`
               channel. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] remove_default_node_pool: If `true`, deletes the default node
               pool upon cluster creation. If you're using `container.NodePool`
               resources with no default node pool, this should be set to `true`, alongside
               setting `initial_node_count` to at least `1`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] resource_labels: The GCE resource labels (a map of key/value pairs) to be applied to the cluster.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] resource_usage_export_config: Configuration for the
               [ResourceUsageExportConfig](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-usage-metering) feature.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
               subnetwork in which the cluster's instances are launched.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] vertical_pod_autoscaling: 
               Vertical Pod Autoscaling automatically adjusts the resources of pods controlled by it.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] workload_identity_config: 
               Workload Identity allows Kubernetes service accounts to act as a user-managed
               [Google IAM Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#user-managed_service_accounts).
               Structure is documented below.

            as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause the provider to
            recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
            Kubernetes (eg. through `kubectl`), and it's recommended that you do not use
            this field to manage taints. If you do, `lifecycle.ignore_changes` is

        :param pulumi.Input[dict] cluster_autoscaling: 
               Per-cluster configuration of Node Auto-Provisioning with Cluster Autoscaler to
               automatically adjust the size of the cluster and create/delete node pools based
               on the current needs of the cluster's workload. See the
               [guide to using Node Auto-Provisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning)
               for more details. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] cluster_ipv4_cidr: The IP address range of the Kubernetes pods
               in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`). Leave blank to have one
               automatically chosen or specify a `/14` block in `10.0.0.0/8`. This field will
               only work for routes-based clusters, where `ip_allocation_policy` is not defined.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] database_encryption: .
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] default_max_pods_per_node: The default maximum number of pods
               per node in this cluster. This doesn't work on "routes-based" clusters, clusters
               that don't have IP Aliasing enabled. See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr)
               for more information.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: Description of the cluster.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_binary_authorization: Enable Binary Authorization for this cluster.
               If enabled, all container images will be validated by Google Binary Authorization.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_intranode_visibility: 
               Whether Intra-node visibility is enabled for this cluster. This makes same node pod to pod traffic visible for VPC network.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_kubernetes_alpha: Whether to enable Kubernetes Alpha features for
               this cluster. Note that when this option is enabled, the cluster cannot be upgraded
               and will be automatically deleted after 30 days.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_legacy_abac: Whether the ABAC authorizer is enabled for this cluster.
               When enabled, identities in the system, including service accounts, nodes, and controllers,
               will have statically granted permissions beyond those provided by the RBAC configuration or IAM.
               Defaults to `false`
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_shielded_nodes: Enable Shielded Nodes features on all nodes in this cluster.  Defaults to `false`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_tpu: Whether to enable Cloud TPU resources in this cluster.
               See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] endpoint: The IP address of this cluster's Kubernetes master.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] initial_node_count: The number of nodes to create in this
               cluster's default node pool. In regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the
               number of nodes per zone. Must be set if `node_pool` is not set. If you're using
               `container.NodePool` objects with no default node pool, you'll need to
               set this to a value of at least `1`, alongside setting
               `remove_default_node_pool` to `true`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] instance_group_urls: List of instance group URLs which have been assigned
               to the cluster.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] ip_allocation_policy: Configuration of cluster IP allocation for
               VPC-native clusters. Adding this block enables [IP aliasing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases),
               making the cluster VPC-native instead of routes-based. Structure is documented
               below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: The fingerprint of the set of labels for this cluster.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] location: The location (region or zone) in which the cluster
               master will be created, as well as the default node location. If you specify a
               zone (such as `us-central1-a`), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a
               single cluster master. If you specify a region (such as `us-west1`), the
               cluster will be a regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in
               the region, and with default node locations in those zones as well
        :param pulumi.Input[str] logging_service: The logging service that the cluster should
               write logs to. Available options include `logging.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver),
               `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Logging), and `none`. Defaults to `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] maintenance_policy: The maintenance policy to use for the cluster. Structure is
               documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] master_auth: The authentication information for accessing the
               Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
               your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
               you see an unexpected diff removing a username/password or unsetting your client
               cert, ensure you have the `container.clusters.getCredentials` permission.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] master_authorized_networks_config: The desired configuration options
               for master authorized networks. Omit the nested `cidr_blocks` attribute to disallow
               external access (except the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] master_version: The current version of the master in the cluster. This may
               be different than the `min_master_version` set in the config if the master
               has been updated by GKE.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] min_master_version: The minimum version of the master. GKE
               will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
               current master version--use the read-only `master_version` field to obtain that.
               If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
               official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
               the `container.getEngineVersions` data source useful - it indicates which versions
               are available. If you intend to specify versions manually,
               [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#specifying_cluster_version)
               describe the various acceptable formats for this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] monitoring_service: The monitoring service that the cluster
               should write metrics to.
               Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
               VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
               Available options include
               `monitoring.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver), `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and `none`.
               Defaults to `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the cluster, unique within the project and
               location.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
               network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the
               shared network.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] network_policy: Configuration options for the
               [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/networkpolicies/)
               feature. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] node_config: Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
               Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
               `container.NodePool` or a `node_pool` block; this configuration
               manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] node_locations: The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
               are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
               same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
               a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] node_pools: List of node pools associated with this cluster.
               See container.NodePool for schema.
               **Warning:** node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
               cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
               to say "these are the _only_ node pools associated with this cluster", use the
               container.NodePool resource instead of this property.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] node_version: The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
               or set to the same value as `min_master_version` on create. Defaults to the default
               version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
               nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
               recommended that you specify explicit versions as the provider will see spurious diffs
               when fuzzy versions are used. See the `container.getEngineVersions` data source's
               `version_prefix` field to approximate fuzzy versions.
               To update nodes in other node pools, use the `version` attribute on the node pool.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] pod_security_policy_config: Configuration for the
               [PodSecurityPolicy](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies) feature.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] private_cluster_config: Configuration for [private clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters),
               clusters with private nodes. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] release_channel: Configuration options for the [Release channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels)
               feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
               When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
               [Migrating between release channels](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#migrating_between_release_channels)
               for more details; the `container.getEngineVersions` datasource can provide
               the default version for a channel. Note that removing the `release_channel`
               field from your config will cause this provider to stop managing your cluster's
               release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the `"UNSPECIFIED"`
               channel. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] remove_default_node_pool: If `true`, deletes the default node
               pool upon cluster creation. If you're using `container.NodePool`
               resources with no default node pool, this should be set to `true`, alongside
               setting `initial_node_count` to at least `1`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] resource_labels: The GCE resource labels (a map of key/value pairs) to be applied to the cluster.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] resource_usage_export_config: Configuration for the
               [ResourceUsageExportConfig](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-usage-metering) feature.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] services_ipv4_cidr: The IP address range of the Kubernetes services in this
               cluster, in [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
               notation (e.g. `1.2.3.4/29`). Service addresses are typically put in the last
               `/16` from the container CIDR.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
               subnetwork in which the cluster's instances are launched.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] tpu_ipv4_cidr_block: The IP address range of the Cloud TPUs in this cluster, in
               [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
               notation (e.g. `1.2.3.4/29`).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] vertical_pod_autoscaling: 
               Vertical Pod Autoscaling automatically adjusts the resources of pods controlled by it.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] workload_identity_config: 
               Workload Identity allows Kubernetes service accounts to act as a user-managed
               [Google IAM Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#user-managed_service_accounts).
               Structure is documented below.

              * `nodeMetadata` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - How to expose the node metadata to the workload running on the node.
                Accepted values are:
                * UNSPECIFIED: Not Set
                * SECURE: Prevent workloads not in hostNetwork from accessing certain VM metadata, specifically kube-env, which contains Kubelet credentials, and the instance identity token. See [Metadata Concealment](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/metadata-proxy) documentation.
                * EXPOSE: Expose all VM metadata to pods.
                * GKE_METADATA_SERVER: Enables [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) on the node.

          * `node_count` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `node_locations` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
            are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
            same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
            a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
          * `upgrade_settings` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`)
            * `maxSurge` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
            * `maxUnavailable` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)

          * `version` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)

        The **pod_security_policy_config** object supports the following:

          * `enabled` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Enable the PodSecurityPolicy controller for this cluster.
            If enabled, pods must be valid under a PodSecurityPolicy to be created.

        The **private_cluster_config** object supports the following:

          * `enablePrivateEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - When `true`, the cluster's private
            endpoint is used as the cluster endpoint and access through the public endpoint
            is disabled. When `false`, either endpoint can be used. This field only applies
            to private clusters, when `enable_private_nodes` is `true`.
          * `enablePrivateNodes` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Enables the private cluster feature,
            creating a private endpoint on the cluster. In a private cluster, nodes only
            have RFC 1918 private addresses and communicate with the master's private
            endpoint via private networking.
          * `masterIpv4CidrBlock` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The IP range in CIDR notation to use for
            the hosted master network. This range will be used for assigning private IP
            addresses to the cluster master(s) and the ILB VIP. This range must not overlap
            with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
            subnet. See [Private Cluster Limitations](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#limitations)
            for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
            `enable_private_nodes` is `true`.
          * `peeringName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the peering between this cluster and the Google owned VPC.
          * `privateEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The internal IP address of this cluster's master endpoint.
          * `publicEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The external IP address of this cluster's master endpoint.

        The **release_channel** object supports the following:

          * `channel` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The selected release channel.
            Accepted values are:
            * UNSPECIFIED: Not set.
            * RAPID: Weekly upgrade cadence; Early testers and developers who requires new features.
            * REGULAR: Multiple per month upgrade cadence; Production users who need features not yet offered in the Stable channel.
            * STABLE: Every few months upgrade cadence; Production users who need stability above all else, and for whom frequent upgrades are too risky.

        The **resource_usage_export_config** object supports the following:

          * `bigqueryDestination` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Parameters for using BigQuery as the destination of resource usage export.
            * `dataset_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)

          * `enableNetworkEgressMetering` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether to enable network egress metering for this cluster. If enabled, a daemonset will be created
            in the cluster to meter network egress traffic.
          * `enableResourceConsumptionMetering` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether to enable resource
            consumption metering on this cluster. When enabled, a table will be created in
            the resource export BigQuery dataset to store resource consumption data. The
            resulting table can be joined with the resource usage table or with BigQuery
            billing export. Defaults to `true`.

        The **vertical_pod_autoscaling** object supports the following:

          * `enabled` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Enable the PodSecurityPolicy controller for this cluster.
            If enabled, pods must be valid under a PodSecurityPolicy to be created.

        The **workload_identity_config** object supports the following:

          * `identityNamespace` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Currently, the only supported identity namespace is the project's default.
