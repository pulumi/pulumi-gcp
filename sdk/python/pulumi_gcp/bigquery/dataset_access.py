        Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
        it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
        `bigquery.Dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.

        > **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `bigquery.Dataset` resource, the
        dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
        `ignore_changes = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.
