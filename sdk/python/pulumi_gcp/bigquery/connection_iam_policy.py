        ## Import

        For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

        * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}

        * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{connection_id}}

        * {{location}}/{{connection_id}}

        * {{connection_id}}

        Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.

        BigQuery Connection connection IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.

        IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
        ```

        IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}} roles/viewer"
        ```

        IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}
        ```

        -> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the

         full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] connection_id: Optional connection id that should be assigned to the created connection.

        ```

        ## Import

        For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

        * projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}

        * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{connection_id}}

        * {{location}}/{{connection_id}}

        * {{connection_id}}

        Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.

        BigQuery Connection connection IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.

        IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
        ```

        IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}} roles/viewer"
        ```

        IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}
        ```

        -> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the

         full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
