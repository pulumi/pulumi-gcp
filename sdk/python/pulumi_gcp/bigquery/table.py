      * `autodetect` (`bool`) - - Let BigQuery try to autodetect the schema
        and format of the table.
      * `compression` (`str`) - The compression type of the data source.
        Valid values are "NONE" or "GZIP".

          CSV file. If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the
          property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline
          characters, you must also set the `allow_quoted_newlines` property to true.
          The API-side default is `"`, specified in the provider escaped as `\"`. Due to

        allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
        If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with
        extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too
        many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.

        Get an existing Table resource's state with the given name, id, and optional extra
        properties used to qualify the lookup.

        :param str resource_name: The unique name of the resulting resource.
        :param str id: The unique provider ID of the resource to lookup.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] clusterings: Specifies column names to use for data clustering.
               Up to four top-level columns are allowed, and should be specified in
               descending priority order.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] creation_time: The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] dataset_id: The dataset ID to create the table in.
               Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: The field description.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] encryption_configuration: Specifies how the table should be encrypted.
               If left blank, the table will be encrypted with a Google-managed key; that process
               is transparent to the user.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] etag: A hash of the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] expiration_time: The time when this table expires, in
               milliseconds since the epoch. If not present, the table will persist
               indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage
               reclaimed.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] external_data_configuration: Describes the data format,
               location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery.
               By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as
               if it were a standard BigQuery table. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] friendly_name: A descriptive name for the table.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] labels: A mapping of labels to assign to the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] last_modified_time: The time when this table was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] location: The geographic location where the table resides. This value is inherited from the dataset.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] num_bytes: The size of this table in bytes, excluding any data in the streaming buffer.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] num_long_term_bytes: The number of bytes in the table that are considered "long-term storage".
        :param pulumi.Input[float] num_rows: The number of rows of data in this table, excluding any data in the streaming buffer.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] range_partitioning: If specified, configures range-based
               partitioning for this table. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] schema: A JSON schema for the table. Schema is required
               for CSV and JSON formats and is disallowed for Google Cloud
               Bigtable, Cloud Datastore backups, and Avro formats when using
               external tables. For more information see the
               [BigQuery API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#resource).
               ~>**NOTE**: Because this field expects a JSON string, any changes to the
               string will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't changed.
               If the API returns a different value for the same schema, e.g. it
               switched the order of values or replaced `STRUCT` field type with `RECORD`
               field type, we currently cannot suppress the recurring diff this causes.
               As a workaround, we recommend using the schema as returned by the API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] table_id: A unique ID for the resource.
               Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] time_partitioning: If specified, configures time-based
               partitioning for this table. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] type: The only type supported is DAY, which will generate
               one partition per day based on data loading time.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] view: If specified, configures this table as a view.
               Structure is documented below.

        The **encryption_configuration** object supports the following:

          * `kms_key_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The self link or full name of a key which should be used to
            encrypt this table.  Note that the default bigquery service account will need to have
            encrypt/decrypt permissions on this key - you may want to see the
            `bigquery.getDefaultServiceAccount` datasource and the
            `kms.CryptoKeyIAMBinding` resource.

        The **external_data_configuration** object supports the following:

          * `autodetect` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - - Let BigQuery try to autodetect the schema
            and format of the table.
          * `compression` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The compression type of the data source.
            Valid values are "NONE" or "GZIP".
          * `csvOptions` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Additional properties to set if
            `source_format` is set to "CSV". Structure is documented below.
            * `allowJaggedRows` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows
              that are missing trailing optional columns.
            * `allowQuotedNewlines` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Indicates if BigQuery should allow
              quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file.
              The default value is false.
            * `encoding` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The character encoding of the data. The supported
              values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.
            * `fieldDelimiter` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The separator for fields in a CSV file.
            * `quote` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The value that is used to quote data sections in a
              CSV file. If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the
              property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline
              characters, you must also set the `allow_quoted_newlines` property to true.
              The API-side default is `"`, specified in the provider escaped as `\"`. Due to
              limitations with default values, this value is required to be
              explicitly set.
            * `skipLeadingRows` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of rows at the top of the sheet
              that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. At least one of `range` or
              `skip_leading_rows` must be set.

          * `googleSheetsOptions` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Additional options if
            `source_format` is set to "GOOGLE_SHEETS". Structure is
            documented below.
            * `range` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Information required to partition based on ranges.
              Structure is documented below.
            * `skipLeadingRows` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of rows at the top of the sheet
              that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. At least one of `range` or
              `skip_leading_rows` must be set.

          * `ignoreUnknownValues` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Indicates if BigQuery should
            allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
            If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with
            extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too
            many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
            The default value is false.
          * `maxBadRecords` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of bad records that
            BigQuery can ignore when reading data.
          * `sourceFormat` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The data format. Supported values are:
            "CSV", "GOOGLE_SHEETS", "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON", "AVRO", "PARQUET",
            and "DATSTORE_BACKUP". To use "GOOGLE_SHEETS"
            the `scopes` must include
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly".
          * `sourceUris` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of the fully-qualified URIs that point to
            your data in Google Cloud.

        The **range_partitioning** object supports the following:

          * `field` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The field used to determine how to create a range-based
            partition.
          * `range` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Information required to partition based on ranges.
            Structure is documented below.
            * `end` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - End of the range partitioning, exclusive.
            * `interval` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The width of each range within the partition.
            * `start` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Start of the range partitioning, inclusive.

        The **time_partitioning** object supports the following:

          * `expirationMs` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of milliseconds for which to keep the
            storage for a partition.
          * `field` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The field used to determine how to create a range-based
            partition.
          * `requirePartitionFilter` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If set to true, queries over this table
            require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be
            specified.
          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The only type supported is DAY, which will generate
            one partition per day based on data loading time.

        The **view** object supports the following:

          * `query` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - A query that BigQuery executes when the view is referenced.
          * `useLegacySql` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL for this view.
            The default value is true. If set to false, the view will use BigQuery's standard SQL.
