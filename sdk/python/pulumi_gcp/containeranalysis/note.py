    Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
    For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
    "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
    grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
    grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
    gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
    Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
    Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
    project.  Structure is documented below.

      * `hint` (`dict`) - This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
        the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
        resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
        name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
        from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
        these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
        in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
        Attestations to verify.  Structure is documented below.
