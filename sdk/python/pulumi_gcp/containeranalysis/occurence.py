    Occurrence that represents a single "attestation". The authenticity
    of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature.
    If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying
    the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance,
    the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily
    useful for lookup (how to find this attestation if you already
    know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (for
    which authority this attestation was intended to sign.  Structure is documented below.

      * `serializedPayload` (`str`) - The serialized payload that is verified by one or
        more signatures. A base64-encoded string.
      * `signatures` (`list`) - One or more signatures over serializedPayload.
        Verifier implementations should consider this attestation
        message verified if at least one signature verifies
        serializedPayload. See Signature in common.proto for more
        details on signature structure and verification.  Structure is documented below.
        * `publicKeyId` (`str`) - The identifier for the public key that verifies this
          signature. MUST be an RFC3986 conformant
          URI. * When possible, the key id should be an
          immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest.

          The payload that this signature verifies MUST be
          unambiguously provided with the Signature during
          verification. A wrapper message might provide the
