        ## Import

        DeployPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{location}}/{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, DeployPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] annotations: Optional. User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used by the user, and not by Cloud Deploy. Annotations
               must meet the following constraints: * Annotations are key/value pairs. * Valid annotation keys have two segments: an
               optional prefix and name, separated by a slash ('/'). * The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less,
               beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ('[a-z0-9A-Z]') with dashes ('-'), underscores ('_'), dots ('.'),
               and alphanumerics between. * The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS
               labels separated by dots('.'), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash ('/'). See
               https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set for more
               details. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field 'effective_annotations' for all of the annotations present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: Optional. Description of the 'DeployPolicy'. Max length is 255 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] labels: Optional. Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the
               following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and
               dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a
               lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels. Both keys and values
               are additionally constrained to be <= 63 characters. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the
               labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the
               resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] location: The location for the resource
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: Name of the `DeployPolicy`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['DeployPolicyRuleArgs', 'DeployPolicyRuleArgsDict']]]] rules: Required. Rules to apply. At least one rule must be present.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['DeployPolicySelectorArgs', 'DeployPolicySelectorArgsDict']]]] selectors: Required. Selected resources to which the policy will be applied. At least one selector is required. If one selector matches the resource the policy applies. For example, if there are two selectors and the action being attempted matches one of them, the policy will apply to that action.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] suspended: Optional. When suspended, the policy will not prevent actions from occurring, even if the action violates the policy.

        ## Import

        DeployPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{location}}/{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, DeployPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/deployPolicy:DeployPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
        ```

               optional prefix and name, separated by a slash ('/'). * The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less,

               dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a

At least one selector is required. If one selector matches the resource the policy applies.
