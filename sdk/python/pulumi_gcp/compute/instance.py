    Additional disks to attach to the instance. Can be repeated multiple times for multiple disks. Structure is documented below.

    The boot disk for the instance.

    Whether to allow sending and receiving of
    packets with non-matching source or destination IPs.
    This defaults to false.

    The CPU platform used by this instance.

    A brief description of this resource.

    """
    A custom hostname for the instance. Must be a fully qualified DNS name and RFC-1035-valid.
    Valid format is a series of labels 1-63 characters long matching the regular expression `a-z`, concatenated with periods.
    The entire hostname must not exceed 253 characters. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

    An alternative to using the
    startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be
    recreated (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the
    startup-script metadata key on the created instance and thus the two
    mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.

    Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the VM instance. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
