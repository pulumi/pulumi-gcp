        :param pulumi.Input[str] cpu_platform: The CPU platform used by this instance.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] deletion_protection: Enable deletion protection on this instance. Defaults to false.
               **Note:** you must disable deletion protection before removing the resource (e.g., via `pulumi destroy`), or the instance cannot be deleted and the provider run will not complete successfully.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: A brief description of this resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] desired_status: Desired status of the instance. Either
               `"RUNNING"` or `"TERMINATED"`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_display: Enable [Virtual Displays](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-instance-virtual-display#verify_display_driver) on this instance.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] metadata_startup_script: An alternative to using the
               startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be
               recreated (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the
               startup-script metadata key on the created instance and thus the two
               mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.  Users are free to use
               either mechanism - the only distinction is that this separate attribute
               willl cause a recreate on modification.  On import, `metadata_startup_script`
               will be set, but `metadata.startup-script` will not - if you choose to use the
               other mechanism, you will see a diff immediately after import, which will cause a
               destroy/recreate operation.  You may want to modify your state file manually
               using `pulumi stack` commands, depending on your use case.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] min_cpu_platform: Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the VM instance. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as

          * `accessConfigs` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Access configurations, i.e. IPs via which this
            instance can be accessed via the Internet. Omit to ensure that the instance
            is not accessible from the Internet. If omitted, ssh will not
            work unless this provider can send traffic to the instance's network (e.g. via
            tunnel or because it is running on another cloud instance on that network).
            This block can be repeated multiple times. Structure documented below.
            * `natIp` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The IP address that will be 1:1 mapped to the instance's

              must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by
              system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address
              (e.g. 10.2.3.4), a netmask (e.g. /24) or a CIDR format string (e.g. 10.1.2.0/24).

              the secondary range from which to allocate the IP CIDR range for this alias IP
              range. If left unspecified, the primary range of the subnetwork will be used.

          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
            Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          * `network` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name or self_link of the network to attach this interface to.
            Either `network` or `subnetwork` must be provided.
          * `networkIp` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The private IP address to assign to the instance. If
            empty, the address will be automatically assigned.
          * `subnetwork` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name or self_link of the subnetwork to attach this
            interface to. The subnetwork must exist in the same region this instance will be

          * `subnetworkProject` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The project in which the subnetwork belongs.
            If the `subnetwork` is a self_link, this field is ignored in favor of the project
            defined in the subnetwork self_link. If the `subnetwork` is a name and this
            field is not provided, the provider project is used.
