        Persistent disks can be attached to a compute instance using the `attached_disk`
        section within the compute instance configuration.
        However there may be situations where managing the attached disks via the compute
        instance config isn't preferable or possible, such as attaching dynamic
        numbers of disks using the `count` variable.


        To get more information about attaching disks, see:

        * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/attachDisk)
        * How-to Guides
            * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)

        **Note:** When using `compute.AttachedDisk` you **must** use `lifecycle.ignore_changes = ["attached_disk"]` on the `compute.Instance` resource that has the disks attached. Otherwise the two resources will fight for control of the attached disk block.
