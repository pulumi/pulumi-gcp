              the response header is set to unavailable

          * `timeout` (`dict`) - Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
            the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the

              been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
              backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
              The value must be between 0 and 1000

            will be retained.
            - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
            the request method will be retained.
          * `stripQuery` (`bool`) - If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior

            configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in
            this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
            filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its

          Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
          in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
          1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
          you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the

            service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
            number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
            the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
            transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
            HttpRouteAction.  Structure is documented below.
            * `backend_service` (`str`) - The default BackendService resource. Before
              forwarding the request to backendService, the loadbalancer applies any relevant
              headerActions specified as part of this backendServiceWeight.
            * `header_action` (`dict`) - Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
              the selected backendService. headerAction specified here take effect before
              headerAction in the enclosing HttpRouteRule, PathMatcher and UrlMap.  Structure is documented below.
              * `requestHeadersToAdds` (`list`) - Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the
                backendService.  Structure is documented below.
                * `headerName` (`str`) - The name of the header.
                * `headerValue` (`str`) - The value of the header to add.
                * `replace` (`bool`) - If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
                  header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
                  were set for that header.

              * `requestHeadersToRemoves` (`list`) - A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request
                prior to forwarding the request to the backendService.
              * `responseHeadersToAdds` (`list`) - Headers to add the response prior to sending the response back to the client.  Structure is documented below.
                * `headerName` (`str`) - The name of the header.
                * `headerValue` (`str`) - The value of the header to add.
                * `replace` (`bool`) - If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
                  header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
                  were set for that header.

              * `responseHeadersToRemoves` (`list`) - A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
                prior to sending the response back to the client.

            * `weight` (`float`) - Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
              (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
              backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
              been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
              backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
              The value must be between 0 and 1000

        * `service` (`str`) - The backend service or backend bucket link that should be matched by this test.
        * `urlRedirect` (`dict`) - When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
          urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be
          set.  Structure is documented below.
          * `hostRedirect` (`str`) - The host that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
            supplied in the request. The value must be between 1 and 255 characters.
          * `httpsRedirect` (`bool`) - If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set to
            false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that of the
            request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys. Setting this
            true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. The default is set to false.
          * `pathRedirect` (`str`) - The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
            supplied in the request. pathRedirect cannot be supplied together with
            prefixRedirect. Supply one alone or neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the
            original request will be used for the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024
            characters.
          * `prefixRedirect` (`str`) - The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the HttpRouteRuleMatch,
            retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
            prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect. Supply one alone or
            neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for
            the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
          * `redirectResponseCode` (`str`) - The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:
            - MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.
            - FOUND, which corresponds to 302.
            - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.
            - TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
            will be retained.
            - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
            the request method will be retained.
          * `stripQuery` (`bool`) - If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior
            to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the original URL is
            retained. The default is set to false.
            This field is required to ensure an empty block is not set. The normal default value is false.

            neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for
            the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
          * `redirectResponseCode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:

            - FOUND, which corresponds to 302.
            - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.
            - TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
            will be retained.
            - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
            the request method will be retained.
          * `stripQuery` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior
            to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the original URL is
            retained. The default is set to false.
            This field is required to ensure an empty block is not set. The normal default value is false.

        The **header_action** object supports the following:

          * `requestHeadersToAdds` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the

            * `replace` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
              header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
              were set for that header.

          * `requestHeadersToRemoves` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request
            prior to forwarding the request to the backendService.

          * `header_action` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
            the selected backendService. headerAction specified here take effect before
            headerAction in the enclosing HttpRouteRule, PathMatcher and UrlMap.  Structure is documented below.
            * `requestHeadersToAdds` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the

          * `pathRules` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
            on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
            are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
            basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
            irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
            given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.  Structure is documented below.
            * `paths` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a
              * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher
              does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
              allowed here.
            * `routeAction` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
              actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
              request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any

                resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection,
                when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by
                Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the

                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

              * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time

              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.

              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
              you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
              future without any impact on existing rules.
            * `routeAction` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
              actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
              request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
              routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction

              * `faultInjectionPolicy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
                resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection,
                when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by
                Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the
                backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
                Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will be

                  origin is allowed if it matches either allow_origins or allow_origin_regex.
                * `disabled` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, specifies the CORS policy is disabled.

                Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the
                backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
                Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will be

                service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.  Structure is documented below.
                * `backend_service` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The default BackendService resource. Before
                  forwarding the request to backendService, the loadbalancer applies any relevant

                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

              * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time

                * `regexMatch` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The queryParameterMatch matches if the value of the parameter matches the
                  regular expression specified by regexMatch. For the regular expression grammar,
                  please see en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript  Only one of presentMatch,
                  exactMatch and regexMatch must be set.

              * `regexMatch` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The queryParameterMatch matches if the value of the parameter matches the
                regular expression specified by regexMatch. For the regular expression grammar,
                please see en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript  Only one of presentMatch,
                exactMatch and regexMatch must be set.

            * `priority` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.
              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
              2147483647 inclusive.
              Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
              you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
              future without any impact on existing rules.

              actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
              request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
              routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
              or urlRedirect must be set.  Structure is documented below.

              * `faultInjectionPolicy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
                resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection,
                when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by
                Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the
                backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
                Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will be

                service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.  Structure is documented below.
                * `backend_service` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The default BackendService resource. Before
                  forwarding the request to backendService, the loadbalancer applies any relevant

                  - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                  any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                  example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused

                  - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                  connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                  - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                  REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                  - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to cancelled
                  - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                  gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                  - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

              * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time

              * `weightedBackendServices` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this

                  (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
                  backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
                  been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same

                retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
                prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect. Supply one alone or
                neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for
                the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
              * `redirectResponseCode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:
                - MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.
                - FOUND, which corresponds to 302.
                - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.
                - TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
                will be retained.

                the request method will be retained.
              * `stripQuery` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior
                to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the original URL is
                retained. The default is set to false.
                This field is required to ensure an empty block is not set. The normal default value is false.
