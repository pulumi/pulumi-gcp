        """
        The set of arguments for constructing a ForwardingRule resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] all_ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `allPorts` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or
               L3_DEFAULT.
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding.
               * Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets
               lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the
               first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this
               forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires `allPorts` be set to
               true.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: This field is used along with the `backend_service` field for
               internal load balancing or with the `target` field for internal
               TargetInstance.
               If the field is set to `TRUE`, clients can access ILB from all
               regions.
               Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
               internal load balancer.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_psc_global_access: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
               Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
               must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
               sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
               to the referenced `target` or `backendService`.
               While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
               required under the following circumstances:
               * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
               `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
               `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
               * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
               bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.
               Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
               existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
               assigns an ephemeral IP address.
               Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
               forwarding rule:
               * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
               * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
               * Full resource URL, as in
               `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * Partial URL or by name, as in:
               * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `global/addresses/address-name`
               * `address-name`
               The forwarding rule's `target` or `backendService`,
               and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
               [IP address
               specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
               address number.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               For protocol forwarding, valid
               options are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`,
               `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP` and
               `L3_DEFAULT`.
               The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
               as described in [Load balancing
               features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
               A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
               backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
               A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
               Possible values are: `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
               Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
               If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
               Possible values are: `IPV4`, `IPV6`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
               packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
               load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
               `PacketMirroring` rule applies to them.
               This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               `loadBalancingScheme` set to `INTERNAL`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
               
               **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type.
               For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
               [Forwarding rule concepts](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
               The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
               Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
               expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
               be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
               cannot be a dash.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
               lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: This field is not used for external load balancing.
               For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
               If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
               If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
               be used.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, a network must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
               this load balancer and can only take the following values:
               `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
               For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are `PREMIUM` and
               `STANDARD`. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
               `PREMIUM`.
               If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be `PREMIUM`.
               If `IPAddress` is specified, this value must be equal to the
               networkTier of the Address.
               Possible values are: `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
               Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
               protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
               * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
               [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
               for details.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
               `portRange`s.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
               cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `ports` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding.
               * You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by
               commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if they share at least one port
               number.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if
               they share at least one port number.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgs'] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
               Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
               belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
               network load balancing with IPv6.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
               However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
               mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.  For
               regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
               forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global
               load balancing resource.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
               *  For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               *  For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle:
               *  `vpc-sc` - [ APIs that support VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products).
               *  `all-apis` - [All supported Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#supported-apis).
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.

        Input properties used for looking up and filtering ForwardingRule resources.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] all_ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `allPorts` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or
               L3_DEFAULT.
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding.
               * Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets
               lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the
               first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this
               forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires `allPorts` be set to
               true.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: This field is used along with the `backend_service` field for
               internal load balancing or with the `target` field for internal
               TargetInstance.
               If the field is set to `TRUE`, clients can access ILB from all
               regions.
               Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
               internal load balancer.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_psc_global_access: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
               Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
               must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] base_forwarding_rule: [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base Forwarding Rule. By base Forwarding Rule, we mean the Forwarding Rule that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the current Forwarding Rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified. Always empty if the current Forwarding Rule does not have sourceIPRanges specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] effective_labels: All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Pulumi, other clients and services.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] forwarding_rule_id: The unique identifier number for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
               sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
               to the referenced `target` or `backendService`.
               While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
               required under the following circumstances:
               * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
               `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
               `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
               * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
               bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.
               Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
               existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
               assigns an ephemeral IP address.
               Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
               forwarding rule:
               * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
               * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
               * Full resource URL, as in
               `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * Partial URL or by name, as in:
               * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `global/addresses/address-name`
               * `address-name`
               The forwarding rule's `target` or `backendService`,
               and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
               [IP address
               specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
               address number.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               For protocol forwarding, valid
               options are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`,
               `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP` and
               `L3_DEFAULT`.
               The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
               as described in [Load balancing
               features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
               A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
               backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
               A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
               Possible values are: `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
               Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
               If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
               Possible values are: `IPV4`, `IPV6`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
               packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
               load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
               `PacketMirroring` rule applies to them.
               This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               `loadBalancingScheme` set to `INTERNAL`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
               internally during updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
               
               **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type.
               For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
               [Forwarding rule concepts](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
               The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
               Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
               expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
               be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
               cannot be a dash.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
               lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: This field is not used for external load balancing.
               For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
               If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
               If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
               be used.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, a network must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
               this load balancer and can only take the following values:
               `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
               For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are `PREMIUM` and
               `STANDARD`. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
               `PREMIUM`.
               If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be `PREMIUM`.
               If `IPAddress` is specified, this value must be equal to the
               networkTier of the Address.
               Possible values are: `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
               Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
               protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
               * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
               [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
               for details.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
               `portRange`s.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
               cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `ports` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding.
               * You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by
               commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if they share at least one port
               number.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if
               they share at least one port number.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] psc_connection_id: The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding Rule.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] psc_connection_status: The PSC connection status of the PSC Forwarding Rule. Possible values: `STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `CLOSED`
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] pulumi_labels: The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
               and default labels configured on the provider.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgs'] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
               Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_name: The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
               belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
               network load balancing with IPv6.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
               However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
               mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.  For
               regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
               forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global
               load balancing resource.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
               *  For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               *  For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle:
               *  `vpc-sc` - [ APIs that support VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products).
               *  `all-apis` - [All supported Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#supported-apis).
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.

        * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
        * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`

        ## Import

        ForwardingRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{region}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, ForwardingRule can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{region}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] all_ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `allPorts` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or
               L3_DEFAULT.
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding.
               * Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets
               lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the
               first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this
               forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires `allPorts` be set to
               true.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: This field is used along with the `backend_service` field for
               internal load balancing or with the `target` field for internal
               TargetInstance.
               If the field is set to `TRUE`, clients can access ILB from all
               regions.
               Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
               internal load balancer.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_psc_global_access: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
               Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
               must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
               sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
               to the referenced `target` or `backendService`.
               While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
               required under the following circumstances:
               * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
               `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
               `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
               * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
               bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.
               Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
               existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
               assigns an ephemeral IP address.
               Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
               forwarding rule:
               * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
               * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
               * Full resource URL, as in
               `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * Partial URL or by name, as in:
               * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `global/addresses/address-name`
               * `address-name`
               The forwarding rule's `target` or `backendService`,
               and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
               [IP address
               specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
               address number.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               For protocol forwarding, valid
               options are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`,
               `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP` and
               `L3_DEFAULT`.
               The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
               as described in [Load balancing
               features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
               A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
               backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
               A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
               Possible values are: `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
               Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
               If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
               Possible values are: `IPV4`, `IPV6`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
               packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
               load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
               `PacketMirroring` rule applies to them.
               This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               `loadBalancingScheme` set to `INTERNAL`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
               
               **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type.
               For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
               [Forwarding rule concepts](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
               The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
               Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
               expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
               be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
               cannot be a dash.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
               lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: This field is not used for external load balancing.
               For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
               If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
               If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
               be used.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, a network must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
               this load balancer and can only take the following values:
               `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
               For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are `PREMIUM` and
               `STANDARD`. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
               `PREMIUM`.
               If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be `PREMIUM`.
               If `IPAddress` is specified, this value must be equal to the
               networkTier of the Address.
               Possible values are: `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
               Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
               protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
               * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
               [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
               for details.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
               `portRange`s.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
               cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `ports` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding.
               * You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by
               commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if they share at least one port
               number.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if
               they share at least one port number.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgs', 'ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgsDict']] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
               Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
               belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
               network load balancing with IPv6.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
               However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
               mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.  For
               regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
               forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global
               load balancing resource.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
               *  For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               *  For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle:

        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{region}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{name}}

               L3_DEFAULT.
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding.
               * Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets
               lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the
               first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this
               forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires `allPorts` be set to
               true.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: This field is used along with the `backend_service` field for
               internal load balancing or with the `target` field for internal
               TargetInstance.
               If the field is set to `TRUE`, clients can access ILB from all
               regions.
               Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
               internal load balancer.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_psc_global_access: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
               Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
               must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] base_forwarding_rule: [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base Forwarding Rule. By base Forwarding Rule, we mean the Forwarding Rule that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the current Forwarding Rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified. Always empty if the current Forwarding Rule does not have sourceIPRanges specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] effective_labels: All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Pulumi, other clients and services.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] forwarding_rule_id: The unique identifier number for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
               sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
               to the referenced `target` or `backendService`.
               While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
               required under the following circumstances:
               * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
               `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
               `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
               * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
               bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.
               Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
               existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
               assigns an ephemeral IP address.
               Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
               forwarding rule:
               * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
               * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
               * Full resource URL, as in
               `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * Partial URL or by name, as in:
               * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
               * `global/addresses/address-name`
               * `address-name`
               The forwarding rule's `target` or `backendService`,
               and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
               [IP address
               specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
               address number.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               For protocol forwarding, valid
               options are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`,
               `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP` and
               `L3_DEFAULT`.
               The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
               as described in [Load balancing
               features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
               A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
               backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
               A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
               Possible values are: `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
               Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
               If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
               Possible values are: `IPV4`, `IPV6`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
               packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
               load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
               `PacketMirroring` rule applies to them.
               This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               `loadBalancingScheme` set to `INTERNAL`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
               internally during updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
               
               **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
               Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type.
               For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
               [Forwarding rule concepts](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
               The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).
               Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
               expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
               be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
               cannot be a dash.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
               lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: This field is not used for external load balancing.
               For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
               If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
               If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
               be used.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
               APIs, a network must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
               this load balancer and can only take the following values:
               `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
               For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are `PREMIUM` and
               `STANDARD`. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
               `PREMIUM`.
               If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be `PREMIUM`.
               If `IPAddress` is specified, this value must be equal to the
               networkTier of the Address.
               Possible values are: `PREMIUM`, `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
               Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
               protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
               * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
               [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
               for details.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
               `portRange`s.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
               cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.
               @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: The `ports`, `portRange`, and `allPorts` fields are mutually exclusive.
               Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
               to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
               The `ports` field has the following limitations:
               * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
               and
               * It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough
               Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network
               Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding.
               * You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by
               commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous.
               For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
               same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if they share at least one port
               number.
               For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
               forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair if
               they share at least one port number.

        :param pulumi.Input[Union['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgs', 'ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationsArgsDict']] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
               Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_name: The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
               belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
               network load balancing with IPv6.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
               However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
               mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.  For
               regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
               forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global
               load balancing resource.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
               *  For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               *  For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle:
               *  `vpc-sc` - [ APIs that support VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products).
               *  `all-apis` - [All supported Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#supported-apis).
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.

        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
        required under the following circumstances:
        * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
        `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
        `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
        * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs

        Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
        existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
        assigns an ephemeral IP address.
        Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
        forwarding rule:
        * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
        * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
        * Full resource URL, as in
