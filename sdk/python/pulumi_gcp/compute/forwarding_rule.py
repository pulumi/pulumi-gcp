    When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
    rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
    rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
    rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same

    of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
    An address must be specified by a literal IP address. > **NOTE**: While
    the API allows you to specify various resource paths for an address resource

        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
               EXTERNAL, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
               Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
               and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
               and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
               this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
               specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
               TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
               TargetPool, TargetInstance.
               Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
               addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
               Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
               disjoint port ranges.
               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
               ports:
               * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
               * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
               * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,

        :param pulumi.Input[list] ports: This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal
               load balancing.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a comma
               separated list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed to
               these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
               forwarding rule.
               You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this
               Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
               optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
               subnetwork must be specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
               The target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target
               object.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
               Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
               scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
               When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
               rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
               rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
               rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
               scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
               rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
               or IPv6.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
               1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the

               instead, this provider requires this to specifically be an IP address to
