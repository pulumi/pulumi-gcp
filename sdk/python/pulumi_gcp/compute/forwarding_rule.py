        The set of arguments for constructing a ForwardingRule resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] all_ports: This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
               when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
               field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
               allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
               with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
               must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
               Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: If true, clients can access ILB from all regions.
               Otherwise only allows from the local region the ILB is located at.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only
               for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
               traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
               the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
               loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
               to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
               reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
               reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
               The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
               that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
               Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
               valid.
               Possible values are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, and `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
               as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
               instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
               mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
               can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
               EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
               Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
               and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
               and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
               EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
               INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, and `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
               this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
               specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
               Possible values are `PREMIUM` and `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
               TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
               TargetPool, TargetInstance.
               Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
               addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
               Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
               disjoint port ranges.
               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
               ports:
               * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
               * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
               * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
               load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
               and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
               A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
               Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
               configured with this forwarding rule.
               You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
               The three are mutually exclusive.
               You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationArgs']]] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with. Currently,
               only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this
               Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
               optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
               subnetwork must be specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
               The target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target
               object.

               Otherwise only allows from the local region the ILB is located at.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only
               for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] creation_timestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
               traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
               the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
               loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
               to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
               reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
               reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
               The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
               that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
               Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.

        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
               as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
               instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
               mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
               can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: Used internally during label updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.

               EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
               Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
               and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
               and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
               EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
               INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, and `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with

        ```

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{region}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import gcp:compute/forwardingRule:ForwardingRule default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] all_ports: This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
               when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
               field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
               allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
               with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
               must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
               Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_global_access: If true, clients can access ILB from all regions.
               Otherwise only allows from the local region the ILB is located at.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] backend_service: A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only
               for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
               traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
               the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
               loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
               to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
               reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
               reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
               The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
               that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
               Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
               valid.
               Possible values are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, and `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
               as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
               instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
               mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
               can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
               EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
               Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
               and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
               and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
               EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
               INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, and `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
               this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
               specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
               Possible values are `PREMIUM` and `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
               TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
               TargetPool, TargetInstance.
               Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
               addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
               Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
               disjoint port ranges.
               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
               ports:
               * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
               * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
               * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
               load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
               and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
               A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
               Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
               configured with this forwarding rule.
               You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
               The three are mutually exclusive.
               You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationArgs']]]] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with. Currently,
               only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] subnetwork: The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this
               Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
               If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
               optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
               subnetwork must be specified.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
               The target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target
               object.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
               traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
               the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
               loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
               type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
               to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
               An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
               reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
               reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
               The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
               that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
               For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
               Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
               valid.
               Possible values are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`, `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, and `L3_DEFAULT`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
               as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
               instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
               mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
               can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: Used internally during label updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[Mapping[str, pulumi.Input[str]]] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
               EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
               Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
               and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
               INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
               and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
               EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
               INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are `EXTERNAL`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL`, and `INTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
               the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
               this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network_tier: The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
               specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
               Possible values are `PREMIUM` and `STANDARD`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
               TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
               TargetPool, TargetInstance.
               Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
               addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
               Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
               disjoint port ranges.
               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
               ports:
               * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
               * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
               * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] ports: This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
               load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
               and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
               A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
               Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
               configured with this forwarding rule.
               You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
               The three are mutually exclusive.
               You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] psc_connection_id: The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding Rule.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] psc_connection_status: The PSC connection status of the PSC Forwarding Rule. Possible values: STATUS_UNSPECIFIED, PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED,
               CLOSED
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
               This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationArgs']]]] service_directory_registrations: Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with. Currently,
               only supports a single Service Directory resource.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
               If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
               name.
               The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
               Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
               regular expression `a-z?` which means the first
               character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
