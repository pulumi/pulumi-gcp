    Represents a Route resource.
    
    A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
    the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
    and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
    routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
    searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
    route.
    
    Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
    specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
    the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
    uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
    remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
    the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
    machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
    Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
    sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.
    
    A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
    nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.
