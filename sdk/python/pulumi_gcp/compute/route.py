        Represents a Route resource.

        A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
        the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
        and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
        routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
        searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
        route.

        Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
        specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
        the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
        uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
        remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
        the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
        machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
        Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
        sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.

        A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
        nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, nextHopVpnTunnel, or
        nextHopIlb.
