    backends: pulumi.Output[list]
    """
    The set of backends that serve this RegionBackendService.  Structure is documented below.

      * `balancingMode` (`str`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
      * `capacityScaler` (`float`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
        (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
        ~>**NOTE**: This field cannot be set for
        INTERNAL region backend services (default loadBalancingScheme),
        but is required for non-INTERNAL backend service. The total
        capacity_scaler for all backends must be non-zero.
        A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
        0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
      * `description` (`str`) - An optional description of this resource.
        Provide this property when you create the resource.
      * `failover` (`bool`) - This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
        than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
      * `group` (`str`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
        of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
        instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
        the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
        are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
        Network Endpoint Group backends.
        When the `load_balancing_scheme` is INTERNAL, only instance groups
        are supported.
        Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
        partial URL.

        Defaults to 1024.
      * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`float`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
        network endpoint can handle. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
        used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
        CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
      * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`float`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
        backend instance can handle. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend
        services.
        This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
        Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
      * `maxRate` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
        Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
        but required if RATE mode. Either maxRate or one
        of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
        group type, must be set.
      * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
        endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
      * `maxRatePerInstance` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
        instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set. Cannot be set
        for INTERNAL backend services.
      * `maxUtilization` (`float`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the

    LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
    hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
    RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent

        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] affinity_cookie_ttl_sec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is
               GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts
               only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The
               maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] backends: The set of backends that serve this RegionBackendService.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] circuit_breakers: Settings controlling the volume of connections to a backend service. This field
               is applicable only when the `load_balancing_scheme` is set to INTERNAL_MANAGED
               and the `protocol` is set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing.
               This field only applies when all of the following are true -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource.
               Provide this property when you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] failover_policy: Policy for failovers.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] health_checks: The set of URLs to HealthCheck resources for health checking
               this RegionBackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified, and a health check is required.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates what kind of load balancing this regional backend service
               will be used for. A backend service created for one type of load
               balancing cannot be used with the other(s).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are -
               ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               This field is applicable only when the `load_balancing_scheme` is set to
               INTERNAL_MANAGED and the `protocol` is set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs.
               This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               This field is applicable only when the `load_balancing_scheme` is set
               to INTERNAL_MANAGED and the `protocol` is set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_name: A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for
               communication to the backend VMs in that group. Required when the
               loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED
               and the backends are instance groups. The named port must be defined on each
               backend instance group. This parameter has no meaning if the backends are NEGs. API sets a
               default of "http" if not given.
               Must be omitted when the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL (Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: The protocol this RegionBackendService uses to communicate with backends.
               The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer
               types and may result in errors if used with the GA API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: The Region in which the created backend service should reside.
               If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

               failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

        The **backends** object supports the following:

          * `balancingMode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
          * `capacityScaler` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
            (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
            ~>**NOTE**: This field cannot be set for
            INTERNAL region backend services (default loadBalancingScheme),
            but is required for non-INTERNAL backend service. The total
            capacity_scaler for all backends must be non-zero.
            A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
            0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the resource.
          * `failover` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
            than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
          * `group` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
            of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
            instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
            the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
            are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
            For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
            endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
            located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
            Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
            Network Endpoint Group backends.
            When the `load_balancing_scheme` is INTERNAL, only instance groups
            are supported.
            Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
            partial URL.
          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
            network endpoint can handle. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
            This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
            used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
            CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
            backend instance can handle. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend
            services.
            This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
            Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
          * `maxRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
            Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
            but required if RATE mode. Either maxRate or one
            of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
            group type, must be set.
          * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
            endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
          * `maxRatePerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
            instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
          * `maxUtilization` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
            CPU utilization target for the group. Valid range is [0.0, 1.0].
            Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend services.

        The **circuit_breakers** object supports the following:

            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxPendingRequests` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of pending requests to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxRequests` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of parallel requests to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxRequestsPerConnection` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Maximum requests for a single backend connection. This parameter
            is respected by both the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 implementations. If
            not specified, there is no limit. Setting this parameter to 1
            will effectively disable keep alive.
          * `maxRetries` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of parallel retries to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 3.

        The **consistent_hash** object supports the following:

          * `httpCookie` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
            that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
            balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.
            This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE.  Structure is documented below.
            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name of the cookie.
            * `path` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Path to set for the cookie.
            * `ttl` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Lifetime of the cookie.  Structure is documented below.
              * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
                less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
                `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
              * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
                inclusive.

          * `httpHeaderName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The hash based on the value of the specified header field.

          * `minimumRingSize` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring.
            Larger ring sizes result in more granular load
            distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool
            is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single
            virtual node.
            Defaults to 1024.

        The **failover_policy** object supports the following:

          * `disableConnectionDrainOnFailover` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
            will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
            to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
            use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the
            following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
            of 10 min.
            This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
            The default is false.
          * `dropTrafficIfUnhealthy` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
            and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
            set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
            The default is false.
          * `failover_ratio` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
            VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
            at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
            In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
            backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
            backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
            VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
            This field is only used with l4 load balancing.

        The **log_config** object supports the following:

          * `enable` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether to enable logging for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.
          * `sampleRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for this backend service. The value of
            the field must be in [0, 1]. This configures the sampling rate of requests to the load balancer
            where 1.0 means all logged requests are reported and 0.0 means no logged requests are reported.
            The default value is 1.0.

        The **outlier_detection** object supports the following:

          * `baseEjectionTime` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base
            time multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected. Defaults to
            30000ms or 30s.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `consecutiveErrors` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When the
            backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error.
            Defaults to 5.
          * `consecutiveGatewayFailure` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of consecutive gateway failures (502, 503, 504 status or connection
            errors that are mapped to one of those status codes) before a consecutive
            gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
          * `enforcingConsecutiveErrors` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
            ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
          * `enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be
            used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
          * `enforcingSuccessRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
            disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
          * `interval` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Time interval between ejection sweep analysis. This can result in both new
            ejections as well as hosts being returned to service. Defaults to 10 seconds.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `maxEjectionPercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool for the backend service
            that can be ejected. Defaults to 10%.
          * `successRateMinimumHosts` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
            success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
            cluster. Defaults to 5.
          * `successRateRequestVolume` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
            defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
            based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
            to 100.
          * `successRateStdevFactor` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
            ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
            rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
            success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
            by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
            runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.

               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing.
               This field only applies when all of the following are true -
        :param pulumi.Input[str] creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates what kind of load balancing this regional backend service
               will be used for. A backend service created for one type of load
               balancing cannot be used with the other(s).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are -
               ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               This field is applicable only when the `load_balancing_scheme` is set to

        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs.
               This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               This field is applicable only when the `load_balancing_scheme` is set

        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_name: A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for
               communication to the backend VMs in that group. Required when the
               loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED
               and the backends are instance groups. The named port must be defined on each
               backend instance group. This parameter has no meaning if the backends are NEGs. API sets a
               default of "http" if not given.
               Must be omitted when the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL (Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: The protocol this RegionBackendService uses to communicate with backends.
               The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer
               types and may result in errors if used with the GA API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: The Region in which the created backend service should reside.
               If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.

               failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

        The **backends** object supports the following:

          * `balancingMode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
          * `capacityScaler` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
            (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
            ~>**NOTE**: This field cannot be set for
            INTERNAL region backend services (default loadBalancingScheme),
            but is required for non-INTERNAL backend service. The total
            capacity_scaler for all backends must be non-zero.
            A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
            0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the resource.
          * `failover` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
            than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
          * `group` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
            of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
            instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
            the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
            are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
            For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
            endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
            located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
            Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
            Network Endpoint Group backends.
            When the `load_balancing_scheme` is INTERNAL, only instance groups
            are supported.
            Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
            partial URL.
          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
            network endpoint can handle. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
            This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
            used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
            CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
            backend instance can handle. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend
            services.
            This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
            Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
          * `maxRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
            Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
            but required if RATE mode. Either maxRate or one
            of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
            group type, must be set.
          * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
            endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
          * `maxRatePerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
            instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set. Cannot be set
            for INTERNAL backend services.
          * `maxUtilization` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
            CPU utilization target for the group. Valid range is [0.0, 1.0].
            Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend services.

        The **circuit_breakers** object supports the following:

          * `connectTimeout` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The timeout for new network connections to hosts.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxPendingRequests` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of pending requests to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxRequests` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of parallel requests to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxRequestsPerConnection` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Maximum requests for a single backend connection. This parameter
            is respected by both the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 implementations. If
            not specified, there is no limit. Setting this parameter to 1
            will effectively disable keep alive.
          * `maxRetries` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of parallel retries to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 3.

        The **consistent_hash** object supports the following:

          * `httpCookie` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
            that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
            balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.
            This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE.  Structure is documented below.
            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name of the cookie.
            * `path` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Path to set for the cookie.
            * `ttl` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Lifetime of the cookie.  Structure is documented below.
              * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
                less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
                `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
              * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
                inclusive.

          * `httpHeaderName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The hash based on the value of the specified header field.
            This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HEADER_FIELD.
          * `minimumRingSize` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring.
            Larger ring sizes result in more granular load
            distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool
            is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single
            virtual node.
            Defaults to 1024.

        The **failover_policy** object supports the following:

          * `disableConnectionDrainOnFailover` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
            will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
            to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
            use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the
            following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
            of 10 min.
            This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
            The default is false.
          * `dropTrafficIfUnhealthy` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
            and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
            set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
            The default is false.
          * `failover_ratio` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
            VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
            at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
            In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
            backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
            backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
            VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
            This field is only used with l4 load balancing.

        The **log_config** object supports the following:

          * `enable` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether to enable logging for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.
          * `sampleRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for this backend service. The value of
            the field must be in [0, 1]. This configures the sampling rate of requests to the load balancer
            where 1.0 means all logged requests are reported and 0.0 means no logged requests are reported.
            The default value is 1.0.

        The **outlier_detection** object supports the following:

          * `baseEjectionTime` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base
            time multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected. Defaults to
            30000ms or 30s.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `consecutiveErrors` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When the
            backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error.
            Defaults to 5.
          * `consecutiveGatewayFailure` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of consecutive gateway failures (502, 503, 504 status or connection
            errors that are mapped to one of those status codes) before a consecutive
            gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
          * `enforcingConsecutiveErrors` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
            ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
          * `enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be
            used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
          * `enforcingSuccessRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
            disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
          * `interval` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Time interval between ejection sweep analysis. This can result in both new
            ejections as well as hosts being returned to service. Defaults to 10 seconds.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `maxEjectionPercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool for the backend service
            that can be ejected. Defaults to 10%.
          * `successRateMinimumHosts` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
            success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
            cluster. Defaults to 5.
          * `successRateRequestVolume` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
            defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
            based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
            to 100.
          * `successRateStdevFactor` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
            ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
            rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
            success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
            by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
            runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
