        Represents an Address resource.

        Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
        optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
        the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
        communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
        you must specify the instance's external IP address.

        Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
        the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
        the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
        Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
        static.

        ## Example Usage - Address Basic


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        ip_address = gcp.compute.Address("ipAddress")
        ```
        ## Example Usage - Address With Subnetwork


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        default_network = gcp.compute.Network("defaultNetwork")
        default_subnetwork = gcp.compute.Subnetwork("defaultSubnetwork",
            ip_cidr_range="10.0.0.0/16",
            region="us-central1",
            network=default_network.id)
        internal_with_subnet_and_address = gcp.compute.Address("internalWithSubnetAndAddress",
            subnetwork=default_subnetwork.id,
            address_type="INTERNAL",
            address="10.0.42.42",
            region="us-central1")
        ```
        ## Example Usage - Address With Gce Endpoint


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        internal_with_gce_endpoint = gcp.compute.Address("internalWithGceEndpoint",
            address_type="INTERNAL",
            purpose="GCE_ENDPOINT")
        ```
        ## Example Usage - Instance With Ip


        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_gcp as gcp

        static = gcp.compute.Address("static")
