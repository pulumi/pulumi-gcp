    Represents an Address resource.
    
    Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
    optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
    the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
    communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
    you must specify the instance's external IP address.
    
    Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
    the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
    the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
    Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
    static.
