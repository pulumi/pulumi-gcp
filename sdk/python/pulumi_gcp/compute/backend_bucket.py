        Backend buckets allow you to use Google Cloud Storage buckets with HTTP(S)
        load balancing.

        An HTTP(S) load balancer can direct traffic to specified URLs to a
        backend bucket rather than a backend service. It can send requests for
        static content to a Cloud Storage bucket and requests for dynamic content
        to a virtual machine instance.


        To get more information about BackendBucket, see:
