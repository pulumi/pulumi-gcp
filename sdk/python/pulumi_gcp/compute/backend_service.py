    """
    backends: pulumi.Output[list]
    """
    The set of backends that serve this BackendService.  Structure is documented below.

      * `balancingMode` (`str`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
        For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
        UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
        and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
      * `capacityScaler` (`float`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
        (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
        Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
        of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
        setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
        0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
      * `description` (`str`) - An optional description of this resource.
        Provide this property when you create the resource.
      * `group` (`str`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
        of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
        instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
        the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
        are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
        For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
        endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
        located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
        Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
        Network Endpoint Group backends.
        Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
        Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
        partial URL.
      * `maxConnections` (`float`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
        Defaults to 1024.
      * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`float`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
        network endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the
        capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
        UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        For CONNECTION mode, either
        maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
      * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`float`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
        backend instance can handle. This is used to calculate the
        capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
        UTILIZATION balancing modes.
        For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
        maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
      * `maxRate` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group.
        Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
        but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one
        of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
        group type, must be set.
      * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
        endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set.
      * `maxRatePerInstance` (`float`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
        instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
        the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
        either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.
      * `maxUtilization` (`float`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
        CPU utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid
        range is [0.0, 1.0].

          string will be included.
          If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
          key entirely.
        * `queryStringBlacklists` (`list`) - Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys.
          All other parameters will be included. Either specify
          query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.

        When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
        internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
        "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
        existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
        responses will not be altered.

               is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is
               set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.  Structure is documented below.

        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_cdn: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
               for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified, and a health check is required.
               For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
               external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
               load balancing cannot be used with the other.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are -
               ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

        :param pulumi.Input[dict] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               This field is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set
               to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_name: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance
               groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing
               scheme is EXTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
               The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer
               types and may result in errors if used with the GA API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] security_policy: The security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] session_affinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is
               not applicable if the protocol is UDP.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] timeout_sec: How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
               failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

        The **backends** object supports the following:

          * `balancingMode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
            For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
            UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
            and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
          * `capacityScaler` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
            (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
            Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
            of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
            setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
            0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the resource.
          * `group` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
            of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
            instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
            the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
            are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
            For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
            endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
            located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
            Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
            Network Endpoint Group backends.
            Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
            partial URL.
          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
            network endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the
            capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
            UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either
            maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
            backend instance can handle. This is used to calculate the
            capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
            UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
          * `maxRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group.
            Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
            but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one
            of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
            group type, must be set.
          * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
            endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxRatePerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
            instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.
          * `maxUtilization` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
            CPU utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid
            range is [0.0, 1.0].

            * `includeQueryString` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, include query string parameters in the cache key
              according to query_string_whitelist and
              query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
              string will be included.
              If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
              key entirely.
            * `queryStringBlacklists` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys.
              All other parameters will be included. Either specify
              query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
              '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
              delimiters.
            * `queryStringWhitelists` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Names of query string parameters to include in cache keys.
              All other parameters will be excluded. Either specify
              query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
              '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
              delimiters.

            will be considered fresh, defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this
            time period, the response will be revalidated before
            being served.
            When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
            internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
            "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
            existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
            responses will not be altered.

            gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
          * `enforcingConsecutiveErrors` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
            status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable

          * `interval` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Time interval between ejection sweep analysis. This can result in both new
            ejections as well as hosts being returned to service. Defaults to 10 seconds.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations

            based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
            to 100.
          * `successRateStdevFactor` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
            ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
            rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
            success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
            by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the

               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to

               load balancing cannot be used with the other.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are -
               ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               This field is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.

        :param pulumi.Input[dict] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               This field is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set
               to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_name: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance
               groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing
               scheme is EXTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
               The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer
               types and may result in errors if used with the GA API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] security_policy: The security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] session_affinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is
               not applicable if the protocol is UDP.

               failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

        The **backends** object supports the following:

          * `balancingMode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
            For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
            UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
            and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
          * `capacityScaler` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
            (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
            Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
            of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
            setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
            0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - An optional description of this resource.
            Provide this property when you create the resource.
          * `group` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
            of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
            instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
            the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
            are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
            For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
            endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
            located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
            Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
            Network Endpoint Group backends.
            Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
            partial URL.
          * `maxConnections` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.
            Defaults to 1024.
          * `maxConnectionsPerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
            network endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the
            capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
            UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either
            maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxConnectionsPerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
            backend instance can handle. This is used to calculate the
            capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
            UTILIZATION balancing modes.
            For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
            maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
          * `maxRate` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) of the group.
            Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
            but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one
            of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
            group type, must be set.
          * `maxRatePerEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
            endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set.
          * `maxRatePerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
            instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
            the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
            either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.
          * `maxUtilization` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
            CPU utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid
            range is [0.0, 1.0].

        The **cdn_policy** object supports the following:

          * `cacheKeyPolicy` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.  Structure is documented below.

            * `includeQueryString` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - If true, include query string parameters in the cache key
              according to query_string_whitelist and
              query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
              string will be included.
              If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
              key entirely.
            * `queryStringBlacklists` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys.
              All other parameters will be included. Either specify
              query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
              '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
              delimiters.
            * `queryStringWhitelists` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Names of query string parameters to include in cache keys.
              All other parameters will be excluded. Either specify
              query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
              '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
              delimiters.

            will be considered fresh, defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this
            time period, the response will be revalidated before
            being served.
            When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
            internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
            "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
            existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
            responses will not be altered.

            * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations
              less than one second are represented with a 0 `seconds` field and a positive
              `nanos` field. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
            * `seconds` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Span of time at a resolution of a second. Must be from 0 to 315,576,000,000
              inclusive.

          * `maxEjectionPercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool for the backend service
            that can be ejected. Defaults to 10%.
          * `successRateMinimumHosts` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
            success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
            cluster. Defaults to 5.
          * `successRateRequestVolume` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
            defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
            based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
            detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
            to 100.
          * `successRateStdevFactor` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
            ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
            rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
            success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
            by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
            runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
