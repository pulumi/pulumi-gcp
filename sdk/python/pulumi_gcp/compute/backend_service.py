        :param pulumi.Input[float] affinity_cookie_ttl_sec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and
               lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value for TTL is one day. When the
               load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] backends: The set of backends that serve this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] cdn_policy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] circuit_breakers: Settings controlling the volume of connections to a backend service. This field is applicable only when the
               load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or
               other properties. This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the destination service. This field
               specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] custom_request_headers: Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied requests.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_cdn: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource for health checking this BackendService. Currently
               at most one health check can be specified, and a health check is required. For internal load balancing, a URL to a
               HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or external load balancing. A backend service created
               for one type of load balancing cannot be used with the other. Must be 'EXTERNAL' or 'INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED' for a global
               backend service. Defaults to 'EXTERNAL'.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality. The possible values are - ROUND_ROBIN - This is a
               simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order. LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which
               selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash
               load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a
               host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to
               the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load
               balancer. MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash
               but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, refer to
               https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service. If logging is
               enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
               comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
               '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
               must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool. This field is applicable only when the
               load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_name: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the
               load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, and
               SSL. The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer types and may result in errors if
               used with the GA API.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] security_policy: The security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] session_affinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is not applicable if the protocol is UDP.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] timeout_sec: How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is
               [1, 86400].
