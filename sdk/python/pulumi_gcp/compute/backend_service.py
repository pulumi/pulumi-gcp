        The set of arguments for constructing a BackendService resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] affinity_cookie_ttl_sec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is
               GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts
               only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The
               maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['BackendServiceBackendArgs']]] backends: The set of backends that serve this BackendService.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceCdnPolicyArgs'] cdn_policy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceCircuitBreakersArgs'] circuit_breakers: Settings controlling the volume of connections to a backend service. This field
               is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] compression_mode: Compress text responses using Brotli or gzip compression, based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
               Possible values are: `AUTOMATIC`, `DISABLED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceConsistentHashArgs'] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is
               set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['BackendServiceCustomMetricArgs']]] custom_metrics: List of custom metrics that are used for the WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN locality_lb_policy.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] custom_request_headers: Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied
               requests.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] custom_response_headers: Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied
               responses.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: An optional description of this resource.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceDynamicForwardingArgs'] dynamic_forwarding: Dynamic forwarding configuration. This field is used to configure the backend service with dynamic forwarding
               feature which together with Service Extension allows customized and complex routing logic.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] edge_security_policy: The resource URL for the edge security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] enable_cdn: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] external_managed_migration_state: Specifies the canary migration state. Possible values are PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and
               TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC.
               To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to
               PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be
               changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate
               traffic by percentage using externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage.
               Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the
               scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at
               the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic
               back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.
               Possible values are: `PREPARE`, `TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE`, `TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.float] external_managed_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests that should be processed by the Global external
               Application Load Balancer.
               The value of this field must be in the range [0, 100].
               Session affinity options will slightly affect this routing behavior, for more details,
               see: Session Affinity.
               This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the backend service is set to
               EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
               for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified.
               A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
               or serverless NEG as a backend.
               For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceIapArgs'] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy.
               If OAuth client is not set, the Google-managed OAuth client is used.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] ip_address_selection_policy: Specifies preference of traffic to the backend (from the proxy and from the client for proxyless gRPC).
               Possible values are: `IPV4_ONLY`, `PREFER_IPV6`, `IPV6_ONLY`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
               external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
               load balancing cannot be used with the other. For more information, refer to
               [Choosing a load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgs']]] locality_lb_policies: A list of locality load balancing policies to be used in order of
               preference. Either the policy or the customPolicy field should be set.
               Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.
               localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is referenced
               by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that has the
               validateForProxyless field set to true.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are:
               * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
               reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
               EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
               configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
               health check replies are expected to contain
               non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
               per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
               based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
               processed health check replies, as long as every
               instance either reported a valid weight or had
               UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
               equal-weight.
               * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
               from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
               responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
               to use for computing the weights are specified via the
               backends[].customMetrics fields.
               locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:
               * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C,
               and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
               * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
               Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
               Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.
               If session_affinity is not NONE, and locality_lb_policy is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
               or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.
               Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
               by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
               field set to true.
               Possible values are: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`, `MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceLogConfigArgs'] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.
               If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceMaxStreamDurationArgs'] max_stream_duration: Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the
               beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that
               does not complete in this duration is closed.
               If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite.
               This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service.
               This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceNetworkPassThroughLbTrafficPolicyArgs'] network_pass_through_lb_traffic_policy: Configures traffic steering properties of internal passthrough Network Load Balancers.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceOutlierDetectionArgs'] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               Applicable backend service types can be a global backend service with the
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] port_name: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance
               groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing
               scheme is EXTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
               The default is HTTP. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, H2C, TCP, SSL, UDP
               or GRPC. Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic Director
               for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend service is referenced
               by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
               Possible values are: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `HTTP2`, `TCP`, `SSL`, `UDP`, `GRPC`, `UNSPECIFIED`, `H2C`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] security_policy: The security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceSecuritySettingsArgs'] security_settings: The security settings that apply to this backend service. This field is applicable to either
               a regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C, and
               load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED; or a global backend service with the
               load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] service_lb_policy: URL to networkservices.ServiceLbPolicy resource.

               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] timeout_sec: The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending on the type of load balancer.
               For more information see, [Backend service settings](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices).

        The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
        The possible values are:
        * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
        is selected in round robin order.
        * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
        hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
        * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
        1/N of the requests.
        * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
        * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
        connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
        to the same address as the destination address of
        the incoming connection before the connection
        was redirected to the load balancer.
        * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
        Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
        build times and host selection times. For more information about
        Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
        * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
        reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
        EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
        configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
        health check replies are expected to contain
        non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
        per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
        based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
        processed health check replies, as long as every
        instance either reported a valid weight or had
        UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
        equal-weight.
        * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
        from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
        responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
        to use for computing the weights are specified via the
        backends[].customMetrics fields.
        locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:
        * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C,

        * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

        Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External

               TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC.
               To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to
               PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be
               changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate
               traffic by percentage using externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage.
               Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the
               scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at
               the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic
               back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.
               Possible values are: `PREPARE`, `TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE`, `TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.float] external_managed_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests that should be processed by the Global external

               Session affinity options will slightly affect this routing behavior, for more details,
               see: Session Affinity.
               This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the backend service is set to
               EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this
               object. This field is used in optimistic locking.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] generated_id: The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
               for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified.
               A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
               or serverless NEG as a backend.
               For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input['BackendServiceIapArgs'] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy.
               If OAuth client is not set, the Google-managed OAuth client is used.

               Possible values are: `IPV4_ONLY`, `PREFER_IPV6`, `IPV6_ONLY`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
               external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
               load balancing cannot be used with the other. For more information, refer to
               [Choosing a load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgs']]] locality_lb_policies: A list of locality load balancing policies to be used in order of
               preference. Either the policy or the customPolicy field should be set.
               Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.
               localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is referenced
               by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that has the
               validateForProxyless field set to true.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are:
               * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
               reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
               EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
               configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
               health check replies are expected to contain
               non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
               per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
               based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
               processed health check replies, as long as every

               responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
               to use for computing the weights are specified via the
               backends[].customMetrics fields.
               locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:

        The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
        The possible values are:
        * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
        is selected in round robin order.
        * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
        hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
        * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
        1/N of the requests.
        * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
        * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
        connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
        to the same address as the destination address of
        the incoming connection before the connection
        was redirected to the load balancer.
        * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
        Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
        build times and host selection times. For more information about
        Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
        * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
        reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
        EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
        configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
        health check replies are expected to contain
        non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
        per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
        based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
        processed health check replies, as long as every
        instance either reported a valid weight or had
        UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
        equal-weight.
        * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
        from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
        responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
        to use for computing the weights are specified via the
        backends[].customMetrics fields.
        locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:
        * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C,

        * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
        Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
        Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.
        If session_affinity is not NONE, and locality_lb_policy is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
        or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.
        Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
        by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
        field set to true.
        Possible values are: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`, `MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`.

        """
        A Backend Service defines a group of virtual machines that will serve
        traffic for load balancing. This resource is a global backend service,
        appropriate for external load balancing or self-managed internal load balancing.
        For managed internal load balancing, use a regional backend service instead.

        Currently self-managed internal load balancing is only available in beta.

        > **Note:** Recreating a `compute.BackendService` that references other dependent resources like `compute.URLMap` will give a `resourceInUseByAnotherResource` error, when modifying the number of other dependent resources.
        Use `lifecycle.create_before_destroy` on the dependent resources to avoid this type of error as shown in the Dynamic Backends example.

        To get more information about BackendService, see:

        ```

        ## Import

        BackendService can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

        * `projects/{{project}}/global/backendServices/{{name}}`

        * `{{project}}/{{name}}`

        * `{{name}}`

        When using the `pulumi import` command, BackendService can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default projects/{{project}}/global/backendServices/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default {{project}}/{{name}}
        ```

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendService:BackendService default {{name}}
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] affinity_cookie_ttl_sec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is
               GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts
               only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The
               maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceBackendArgs', 'BackendServiceBackendArgsDict']]]] backends: The set of backends that serve this BackendService.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceCdnPolicyArgs', 'BackendServiceCdnPolicyArgsDict']] cdn_policy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceCircuitBreakersArgs', 'BackendServiceCircuitBreakersArgsDict']] circuit_breakers: Settings controlling the volume of connections to a backend service. This field
               is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] compression_mode: Compress text responses using Brotli or gzip compression, based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
               Possible values are: `AUTOMATIC`, `DISABLED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceConsistentHashArgs', 'BackendServiceConsistentHashArgsDict']] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is
               set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceCustomMetricArgs', 'BackendServiceCustomMetricArgsDict']]]] custom_metrics: List of custom metrics that are used for the WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN locality_lb_policy.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] custom_request_headers: Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied
               requests.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[builtins.str]]] custom_response_headers: Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied
               responses.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: An optional description of this resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceDynamicForwardingArgs', 'BackendServiceDynamicForwardingArgsDict']] dynamic_forwarding: Dynamic forwarding configuration. This field is used to configure the backend service with dynamic forwarding
               feature which together with Service Extension allows customized and complex routing logic.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] edge_security_policy: The resource URL for the edge security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] enable_cdn: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] external_managed_migration_state: Specifies the canary migration state. Possible values are PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and
               TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC.
               To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to
               PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be
               changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate
               traffic by percentage using externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage.
               Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the
               scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at
               the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic
               back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.
               Possible values are: `PREPARE`, `TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE`, `TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.float] external_managed_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests that should be processed by the Global external
               Application Load Balancer.
               The value of this field must be in the range [0, 100].
               Session affinity options will slightly affect this routing behavior, for more details,
               see: Session Affinity.
               This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the backend service is set to
               EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
               for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified.
               A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
               or serverless NEG as a backend.
               For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceIapArgs', 'BackendServiceIapArgsDict']] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy.
               If OAuth client is not set, the Google-managed OAuth client is used.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] ip_address_selection_policy: Specifies preference of traffic to the backend (from the proxy and from the client for proxyless gRPC).
               Possible values are: `IPV4_ONLY`, `PREFER_IPV6`, `IPV6_ONLY`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
               external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
               load balancing cannot be used with the other. For more information, refer to
               [Choosing a load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgs', 'BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgsDict']]]] locality_lb_policies: A list of locality load balancing policies to be used in order of
               preference. Either the policy or the customPolicy field should be set.
               Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.
               localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is referenced
               by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that has the
               validateForProxyless field set to true.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are:
               * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
               reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
               EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
               configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
               health check replies are expected to contain
               non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
               per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
               based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
               processed health check replies, as long as every
               instance either reported a valid weight or had
               UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
               equal-weight.
               * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
               from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
               responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
               to use for computing the weights are specified via the
               backends[].customMetrics fields.
               locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:
               * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C,
               and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
               * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
               Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
               Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.
               If session_affinity is not NONE, and locality_lb_policy is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
               or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.
               Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
               by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
               field set to true.
               Possible values are: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`, `MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceLogConfigArgs', 'BackendServiceLogConfigArgsDict']] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.
               If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceMaxStreamDurationArgs', 'BackendServiceMaxStreamDurationArgsDict']] max_stream_duration: Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the
               beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that
               does not complete in this duration is closed.
               If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite.
               This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service.
               This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
               
               
               - - -
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceNetworkPassThroughLbTrafficPolicyArgs', 'BackendServiceNetworkPassThroughLbTrafficPolicyArgsDict']] network_pass_through_lb_traffic_policy: Configures traffic steering properties of internal passthrough Network Load Balancers.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceOutlierDetectionArgs', 'BackendServiceOutlierDetectionArgsDict']] outlier_detection: Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
               Applicable backend service types can be a global backend service with the
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] port_name: Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance
               groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing
               scheme is EXTERNAL.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

               The default is HTTP. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, H2C, TCP, SSL, UDP
               or GRPC. Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic Director
               for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend service is referenced
               by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
               Possible values are: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `HTTP2`, `TCP`, `SSL`, `UDP`, `GRPC`, `UNSPECIFIED`, `H2C`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] security_policy: The security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceSecuritySettingsArgs', 'BackendServiceSecuritySettingsArgsDict']] security_settings: The security settings that apply to this backend service. This field is applicable to either
               a regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C, and
               load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED; or a global backend service with the

               GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts
               only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The
               maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceBackendArgs', 'BackendServiceBackendArgsDict']]]] backends: The set of backends that serve this BackendService.
               Structure is documented below.

               is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] compression_mode: Compress text responses using Brotli or gzip compression, based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
               Possible values are: `AUTOMATIC`, `DISABLED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] connection_draining_timeout_sec: Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
               connections, but still work to finish started).
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceConsistentHashArgs', 'BackendServiceConsistentHashArgsDict']] consistent_hash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
               affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
               policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
               destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
               destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
               hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is
               set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceCustomMetricArgs', 'BackendServiceCustomMetricArgsDict']]]] custom_metrics: List of custom metrics that are used for the WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN locality_lb_policy.

        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] description: An optional description of this resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceDynamicForwardingArgs', 'BackendServiceDynamicForwardingArgsDict']] dynamic_forwarding: Dynamic forwarding configuration. This field is used to configure the backend service with dynamic forwarding
               feature which together with Service Extension allows customized and complex routing logic.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] edge_security_policy: The resource URL for the edge security policy associated with this backend service.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.bool] enable_cdn: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] external_managed_migration_state: Specifies the canary migration state. Possible values are PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and
               TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC.
               To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to
               PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be
               changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate
               traffic by percentage using externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage.
               Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the
               scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at
               the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic
               back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.
               Possible values are: `PREPARE`, `TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE`, `TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.float] external_managed_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests that should be processed by the Global external
               Application Load Balancer.
               The value of this field must be in the range [0, 100].
               Session affinity options will slightly affect this routing behavior, for more details,
               see: Session Affinity.
               This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the backend service is set to
               EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this
               object. This field is used in optimistic locking.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.int] generated_id: The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] health_checks: The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
               for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
               check can be specified.
               A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
               or serverless NEG as a backend.
               For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceIapArgs', 'BackendServiceIapArgsDict']] iap: Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy.
               If OAuth client is not set, the Google-managed OAuth client is used.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] ip_address_selection_policy: Specifies preference of traffic to the backend (from the proxy and from the client for proxyless gRPC).
               Possible values are: `IPV4_ONLY`, `PREFER_IPV6`, `IPV6_ONLY`.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] load_balancing_scheme: Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
               external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
               load balancing cannot be used with the other. For more information, refer to
               [Choosing a load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service).
               Default value is `EXTERNAL`.
               Possible values are: `EXTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`, `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgs', 'BackendServiceLocalityLbPolicyArgsDict']]]] locality_lb_policies: A list of locality load balancing policies to be used in order of
               preference. Either the policy or the customPolicy field should be set.
               Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.
               localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is referenced
               by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that has the
               validateForProxyless field set to true.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] locality_lb_policy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
               The possible values are:
               * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
               is selected in round robin order.
               * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
               hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
               * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
               hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
               addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
               1/N of the requests.
               * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
               * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
               connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
               to the same address as the destination address of
               the incoming connection before the connection
               was redirected to the load balancer.
               * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
               Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
               build times and host selection times. For more information about
               Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
               * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
               reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
               EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
               configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
               health check replies are expected to contain
               non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
               per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
               based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
               processed health check replies, as long as every
               instance either reported a valid weight or had
               UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
               equal-weight.
               * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
               from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
               responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
               X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
               to use for computing the weights are specified via the
               backends[].customMetrics fields.
               locality_lb_policy is applicable to either:
               * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C,
               and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
               * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
               Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
               Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.
               If session_affinity is not NONE, and locality_lb_policy is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
               or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.
               Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
               by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
               field set to true.
               Possible values are: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`, `MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`, `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceLogConfigArgs', 'BackendServiceLogConfigArgsDict']] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.
               If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Union['BackendServiceMaxStreamDurationArgs', 'BackendServiceMaxStreamDurationArgsDict']] max_stream_duration: Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the
               beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that
               does not complete in this duration is closed.
               If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite.
               This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service.
               This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[builtins.str] name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last

        * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
        is selected in round robin order.
        * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
        hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
        * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
        1/N of the requests.
        * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
        * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
        connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
        to the same address as the destination address of
        the incoming connection before the connection
        was redirected to the load balancer.
        * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
        Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
        build times and host selection times. For more information about
        Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
        * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
        reported weights. Only applicable to loadBalancingScheme
        EXTERNAL. If set, the Backend Service must
        configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
        health check replies are expected to contain
        non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
        per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
        based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
        processed health check replies, as long as every
        instance either reported a valid weight or had
        UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
        equal-weight.
        * `WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN`: Per-endpoint weighted round-robin Load Balancing using weights computed
        from Backend reported Custom Metrics. If set, the Backend Service
        responses are expected to contain non-standard HTTP response header field
        X-Endpoint-Load-Metrics. The reported metrics
        to use for computing the weights are specified via the
        backends[].customMetrics fields.
