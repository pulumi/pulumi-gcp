    The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
    Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
    scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
    When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
    rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
    rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
    rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
    scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
    rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
    or IPv6.
    When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
    1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
    forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
    internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range
    of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
    An address must be specified by a literal IP address. > **NOTE**: While
    the API allows you to specify various resource paths for an address resource
    instead, this provider requires this to specifically be an IP address to
    avoid needing to fetching the IP address from resource paths on refresh
    or unnecessary diffs.

        """
        Get an existing GlobalForwardingRule resource's state with the given name, id, and optional extra
        properties used to qualify the lookup.

        :param str resource_name: The unique name of the resulting resource.
        :param str id: The unique provider ID of the resource to lookup.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_address: The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
               Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
               scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
               When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
               rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
               rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
               rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
               scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
               rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
               or IPv6.
               When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
               1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
               forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
               internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range
               of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
               An address must be specified by a literal IP address. > **NOTE**: While
               the API allows you to specify various resource paths for an address resource
               instead, this provider requires this to specifically be an IP address to
               avoid needing to fetching the IP address from resource paths on refresh
               or unnecessary diffs.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. When the load balancing scheme is
               INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCP is valid.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_version: The IP Version that will be used by this global forwarding rule.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] label_fingerprint: The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource. Used internally during updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] load_balancing_scheme: This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
               The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for
               Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this
               will be used for External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB,
               External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy)
               NOTE: Currently global forwarding rules cannot be used for INTERNAL
               load balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] metadata_filters: Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
               configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
               requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
               match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
               to those proxies.
               For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
               to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
               corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
               is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
               corresponding labels in the provided metadata.
               metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
               the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
               metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
               loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the metadata label. The length must be between
               1 and 1024 characters, inclusive.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: This field is not used for external load balancing.
               For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field
               identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to
               for this global forwarding rule. If this field is not specified,
               the default network will be used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] port_range: This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
               TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
               TargetPool, TargetInstance.
               Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
               addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
               Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
               disjoint port ranges.
               Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
               ports:
               * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
               * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
               * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
               1883, 5222
               * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
               The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
               For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
               are valid.

        The **metadata_filters** object supports the following:

          * `filterLabels` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the
            provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria
            This list must not be empty and can have at the most 64 entries.  Structure is documented below.
            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name of the metadata label. The length must be between
              1 and 1024 characters, inclusive.
            * `value` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The value that the label must match. The value has a maximum
              length of 1024 characters.

          * `filterMatchCriteria` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Specifies how individual filterLabel matches within the list of
            filterLabels contribute towards the overall metadataFilter match.
            MATCH_ANY - At least one of the filterLabels must have a matching
            label in the provided metadata.
            MATCH_ALL - All filterLabels must have matching labels in the
            provided metadata.
