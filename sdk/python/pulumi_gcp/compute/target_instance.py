        Represents a TargetInstance resource which defines an endpoint instance
        that terminates traffic of certain protocols. In particular, they are used
        in Protocol Forwarding, where forwarding rules can send packets to a
        non-NAT'ed target instance. Each target instance contains a single
        virtual machine instance that receives and handles traffic from the
        corresponding forwarding rules.
