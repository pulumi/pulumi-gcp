        The **auto_healing_policies** object supports the following:

          * `healthCheck` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The health check resource that signals autohealing.
          * `initialDelaySec` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of seconds that the managed instance group waits before
            it applies autohealing policies to new instances or recently recreated instances. Between 0 and 3600.

        The **named_ports** object supports the following:

          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Version name.
          * `port` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The port number.
            - - -

        The **stateful_disks** object supports the following:

          * `deleteRule` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - , A value that prescribes what should happen to the stateful disk when the VM instance is deleted. The available options are `NEVER` and `ON_PERMANENT_INSTANCE_DELETION`. `NEVER` detatch the disk when the VM is deleted, but not delete the disk. `ON_PERMANENT_INSTANCE_DELETION` will delete the stateful disk when the VM is permanently deleted from the instance group. The default is `NEVER`.
          * `device_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - , The device name of the disk to be attached.

        The **update_policy** object supports the following:

          * `maxSurgeFixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances that can be created above the specified targetSize during the update process. Conflicts with `max_surge_percent`. If neither is set, defaults to 1
          * `maxSurgePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances(calculated as percentage) that can be created above the specified targetSize during the update process. Conflicts with `max_surge_fixed`.
          * `maxUnavailableFixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update process. Conflicts with `max_unavailable_percent`. If neither is set, defaults to 1
          * `maxUnavailablePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances(calculated as percentage) that can be unavailable during the update process. Conflicts with `max_unavailable_fixed`.
          * `minReadySec` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , Minimum number of seconds to wait for after a newly created instance becomes available. This value must be from range [0, 3600]
            - - -
          * `minimal_action` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Minimal action to be taken on an instance. You can specify either `RESTART` to restart existing instances or `REPLACE` to delete and create new instances from the target template. If you specify a `RESTART`, the Updater will attempt to perform that action only. However, if the Updater determines that the minimal action you specify is not enough to perform the update, it might perform a more disruptive action.
          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - The type of update process. You can specify either `PROACTIVE` so that the instance group manager proactively executes actions in order to bring instances to their target versions or `OPPORTUNISTIC` so that no action is proactively executed but the update will be performed as part of other actions (for example, resizes or recreateInstances calls).

        The **versions** object supports the following:

          * `instanceTemplate` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - The full URL to an instance template from which all new instances of this version will be created.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Version name.
          * `target_size` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - - The number of instances calculated as a fixed number or a percentage depending on the settings. Structure is documented below.
            * `fixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The number of instances which are managed for this version. Conflicts with `percent`.
            * `percent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The number of instances (calculated as percentage) which are managed for this version. Conflicts with `fixed`.
              Note that when using `percent`, rounding will be in favor of explicitly set `target_size` values; a managed instance group with 2 instances and 2 `version`s,
              one of which has a `target_size.percent` of `60` will create 2 instances of that `version`.
