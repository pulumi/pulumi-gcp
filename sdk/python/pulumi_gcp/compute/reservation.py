        Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is
        held in a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.

        Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
        Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
        `g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
        services not listed above
        like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.
