        A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
        that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
        provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
        instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
        other network-related resources.

        Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
        global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
        instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
        private IP addresses.

        Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
        within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
        a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
        space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
        When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
        instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.

        Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
        instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
        region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
        of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.

          * `metadata` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is enabled.
            Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported VPC
            flow logs.

        The **secondary_ip_ranges** object supports the following:

          * `ip_cidr_range` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The range of IP addresses belonging to this subnetwork secondary
            range. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork.
            Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping with all primary and
            secondary IP ranges within a network. Only IPv4 is supported.
          * `rangeName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name associated with this subnetwork secondary range, used
            when adding an alias IP range to a VM instance. The name must
            be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. The name
            must be unique within the subnetwork.
