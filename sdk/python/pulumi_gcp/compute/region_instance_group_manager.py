               group. You can specify one or more values. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/distributing-instances-with-regional-instance-groups#selectingzones).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] fingerprint: The fingerprint of the instance group manager.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] instance_group: The full URL of the instance group created by the manager.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: - Version name.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] named_ports: The named port configuration. See the section below
               for details on configuration.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
               is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: The region where the managed instance group resides.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URL of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] stateful_disks: Disks created on the instances that will be preserved on instance delete, update, etc. Structure is documented below. For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/configuring-stateful-disks-in-migs). Proactive cross zone instance redistribution must be disabled before you can update stateful disks on existing instance group managers. This can be controlled via the `update_policy`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] target_pools: The full URL of all target pools to which new
               instances in the group are added. Updating the target pools attribute does
               not affect existing instances.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] target_size: - The number of instances calculated as a fixed number or a percentage depending on the settings. Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] update_policy: The update policy for this managed instance group. Structure is documented below. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/updating-managed-instance-groups) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionInstanceGroupManagers/patch)
        :param pulumi.Input[list] versions: Application versions managed by this instance group. Each
               version deals with a specific instance template, allowing canary release scenarios.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] wait_for_instances: Whether to wait for all instances to be created/updated before
               returning. Note that if this is set to true and the operation does not succeed, the provider will
               continue trying until it times out.

        The **auto_healing_policies** object supports the following:

          * `healthCheck` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The health check resource that signals autohealing.
          * `initialDelaySec` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of seconds that the managed instance group waits before
            it applies autohealing policies to new instances or recently recreated instances. Between 0 and 3600.

        The **named_ports** object supports the following:

          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Version name.
          * `port` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The port number.
            - - -

        The **stateful_disks** object supports the following:

          * `deleteRule` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - , A value that prescribes what should happen to the stateful disk when the VM instance is deleted. The available options are `NEVER` and `ON_PERMANENT_INSTANCE_DELETION`. `NEVER` detatch the disk when the VM is deleted, but not delete the disk. `ON_PERMANENT_INSTANCE_DELETION` will delete the stateful disk when the VM is permanently deleted from the instance group. The default is `NEVER`.
          * `device_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - , The device name of the disk to be attached.

        The **update_policy** object supports the following:

          * `instanceRedistributionType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - The instance redistribution policy for regional managed instance groups. Valid values are: `"PROACTIVE"`, `"NONE"`. If `PROACTIVE` (default), the group attempts to maintain an even distribution of VM instances across zones in the region. If `NONE`, proactive redistribution is disabled.
          * `maxSurgeFixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances that can be created above the specified targetSize during the update process. Conflicts with `max_surge_percent`. It has to be either 0 or at least equal to the number of zones.  If fixed values are used, at least one of `max_unavailable_fixed` or `max_surge_fixed` must be greater than 0.
          * `maxSurgePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances(calculated as percentage) that can be created above the specified targetSize during the update process. Conflicts with `max_surge_fixed`. Percent value is only allowed for regional managed instance groups with size at least 10.
          * `maxUnavailableFixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update process. Conflicts with `max_unavailable_percent`. It has to be either 0 or at least equal to the number of zones. If fixed values are used, at least one of `max_unavailable_fixed` or `max_surge_fixed` must be greater than 0.
          * `maxUnavailablePercent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The maximum number of instances(calculated as percentage) that can be unavailable during the update process. Conflicts with `max_unavailable_fixed`. Percent value is only allowed for regional managed instance groups with size at least 10.
          * `minReadySec` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , Minimum number of seconds to wait for after a newly created instance becomes available. This value must be from range [0, 3600]
            - - -
          * `minimal_action` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Minimal action to be taken on an instance. You can specify either `RESTART` to restart existing instances or `REPLACE` to delete and create new instances from the target template. If you specify a `RESTART`, the Updater will attempt to perform that action only. However, if the Updater determines that the minimal action you specify is not enough to perform the update, it might perform a more disruptive action.
          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - The type of update process. You can specify either `PROACTIVE` so that the instance group manager proactively executes actions in order to bring instances to their target versions or `OPPORTUNISTIC` so that no action is proactively executed but the update will be performed as part of other actions (for example, resizes or recreateInstances calls).

        The **versions** object supports the following:

          * `instanceTemplate` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - The full URL to an instance template from which all new instances of this version will be created.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - - Version name.
          * `target_size` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - - The number of instances calculated as a fixed number or a percentage depending on the settings. Structure is documented below.
            * `fixed` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The number of instances which are managed for this version. Conflicts with `percent`.
            * `percent` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - , The number of instances (calculated as percentage) which are managed for this version. Conflicts with `fixed`.
              Note that when using `percent`, rounding will be in favor of explicitly set `target_size` values; a managed instance group with 2 instances and 2 `version`s,
              one of which has a `target_size.percent` of `60` will create 2 instances of that `version`.
