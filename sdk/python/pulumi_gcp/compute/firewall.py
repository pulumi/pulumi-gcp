        Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
        instances.

        All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
        firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.

        The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
        shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
        automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
        outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
        networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
        you need.

        To get more information about Firewall, see:

        ## Example Usage

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['FirewallAllowArgs']]]] allows: The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule
               specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted
               connection.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['FirewallDenyArgs']]]] denies: The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies
               a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
               you create the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] destination_ranges: If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
               traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges
               must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] direction: Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is
               INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify
               destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify
               sourceRanges OR sourceTags.
               Possible values are `INGRESS` and `EGRESS`.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] disabled: Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the
               network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is
               not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this
               is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_logging: This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule.
               If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver. Deprecated in favor of `log_config`
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['FirewallLogConfigArgs']] log_config: This field denotes the logging options for a particular firewall rule.
               If defined, logging is enabled, and logs will be exported to Cloud Logging.
               Structure is documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
               created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
               RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
               the regular expression `a-z?` which means the
               first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
               characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
               character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The name or self_link of the network to attach this firewall to.
        :param pulumi.Input[int] priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
               inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
               priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
               priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
               higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
               precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_ranges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
               traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
               be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
               sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
               apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
               source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
               connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
               apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_service_accounts: If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
               to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
               list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
               instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
               with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
               same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
               apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
               source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
               sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
               properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
               used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] source_tags: If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
               with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
               tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
               address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
               address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
               both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
               source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
               a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
               to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] target_service_accounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the
               network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
               targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
               sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
               specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
               network.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[str]]] target_tags: A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
               network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
               If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all
               instances on the specified network.
