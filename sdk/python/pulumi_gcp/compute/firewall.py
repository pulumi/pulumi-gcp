        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The name or self_link of the network to attach this firewall to.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
               inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
               priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
               priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
               higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
               precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] project: The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
               If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] self_link: The URI of the created resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] source_ranges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
               traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
               be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
               sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
               apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
               source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
               connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
               apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] source_service_accounts: If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
               to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
               list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
               instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
               with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
               same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
               apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
               source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
               sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
               properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
               used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] source_tags: If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
               with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
               tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
               address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
               address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
               both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
               source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
               a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
               to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] target_service_accounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the
               network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
               targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
               sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
               specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
               network.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] target_tags: A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
               network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
               If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all
               instances on the specified network.

        The **allows** object supports the following:

          * `ports` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field
            is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be
            either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule
            applies to connections through any port.
            Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and
            ["12345-12349"].
          * `protocol` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is
            required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be
            one of the following well known protocol strings (tcp, udp,
            icmp, esp, ah, sctp, ipip), or the IP protocol number.

        The **denies** object supports the following:

          * `ports` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field
            is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be
            either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule
            applies to connections through any port.
            Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and
            ["12345-12349"].
          * `protocol` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is
            required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be
            one of the following well known protocol strings (tcp, udp,
            icmp, esp, ah, sctp, ipip), or the IP protocol number.
