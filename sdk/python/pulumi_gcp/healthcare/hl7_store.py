            * send_date or sendDate, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's timeZone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_date < "2017-01-02".
            * sendTime, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, sendTime < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00".
            * sendFacility, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, sendFacility = "ABC".
            * PatientId(value, type), which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, PatientId("123456", "MRN").
            * labels.x, a string value of the label with key x as set using the Message.labels map. For example, labels."priority"="high". The operator :* can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, labels."priority":*.
          * `pubsubTopic` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
            PubsubMessage.Data will contain the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message.
            It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
            was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
            project. cloud-healthcare@system.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
            Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.

        The **parser_config** object supports the following:

          * `allowNullHeader` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Determines whether messages with no header are allowed.
          * `schema` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - JSON encoded string for schemas used to parse messages in this
            store if schematized parsing is desired.
          * `segmentTerminator` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Byte(s) to be used as the segment terminator. If this is unset, '\r' will be used as segment terminator.
            A base64-encoded string.
