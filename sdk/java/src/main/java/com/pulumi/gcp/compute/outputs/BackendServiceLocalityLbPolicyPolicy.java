     * This field should only be populated when the customPolicy field is not
     * used.
     * Note that specifying the same policy more than once for a backend is
     * not a valid configuration and will be rejected.
     * The possible values are:
     * * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
     *   is selected in round robin order.
     * * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
     *   hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
     * * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
     *   hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
     *   addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
     *   1/N of the requests.
     * * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
     * * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
     *   connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
     *   to the same address as the destination address of
     *   the incoming connection before the connection
     *   was redirected to the load balancer.
     * * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
     *   Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
     *   build times and host selection times. For more information about
     *   Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
     *   Possible values are: `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`, `MAGLEV`.
