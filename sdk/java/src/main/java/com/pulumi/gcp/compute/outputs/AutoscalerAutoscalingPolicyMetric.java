     * This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for

     * is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
     * You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
     * You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
     * any functions for each selector.
     * You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
     * metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
     * be identical.
     * The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
     * expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
     * expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
     * instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
     * labels.
     * If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
     * this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
     * instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
     * point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
     * This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
     * If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
     * You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
     * one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
     * (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
     * TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
     * will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.
