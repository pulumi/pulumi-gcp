     * defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendService or BackendBucket responds with an error.

If an error code does not have a policy defined in defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
     * For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:
     * UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors
     * A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404.
     * If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher&#39;s policy takes effect.

If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
     * When used in conjunction with pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client.
