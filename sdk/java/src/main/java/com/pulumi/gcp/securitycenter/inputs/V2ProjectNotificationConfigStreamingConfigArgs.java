     * logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
     * has higher precedence than AND.
     * Restrictions have the form &lt;field&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt; and may have
     * a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
     * map to those defined in the corresponding resource.
     * The supported operators are:
     * * = for all value types.
     * * &gt; , &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= for integer values.
     * * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
