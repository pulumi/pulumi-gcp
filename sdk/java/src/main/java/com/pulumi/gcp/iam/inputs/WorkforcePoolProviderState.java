        /**
         * @param attributeMapping Maps attributes from the authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider
         * to Google Cloud attributes, such as `subject` and `segment`.
         * Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to.
         * The following keys are supported:
         * * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings.
         *   This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and
         *   the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes.
         * * `google.groups`: Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to
         *   resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of the group.
         * * `google.display_name`: The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and
         *   the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject` will be displayed instead.
         *   This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings.
         * * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the authenticated user&#39;s thumbnail photo.
         *   This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user&#39;s profile picture.
         *   If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead.
         *   This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings.
         *   You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where {custom_attribute}
         *   is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes.
         *   The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_].
         *   You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool
         *   to Google Cloud resources. For example:
         * * `google.subject`:
         *   `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/{location}/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value}`
         * * `google.groups`:
         *   `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/{location}/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value}`
         * * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`:
         *   `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/{location}/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}`
         *   Each value must be a [Common Expression Language](https://opensource.google/projects/cel)
         *   function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified
         *   by the corresponding map key.
         *   You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of
         *   the authentication credential issued by the provider.
         *   The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated,
         *   the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB.
         *   For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the `google.subject` attribute.
         *   For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute
         *   on a Google token:
         * An object containing a list of `&#34;key&#34;: value` pairs.
         * Example: `{ &#34;name&#34;: &#34;wrench&#34;, &#34;mass&#34;: &#34;1.3kg&#34;, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;3&#34; }`.
