     * ENFORCED
     * Firebase App Check is enforced for the service. The service will reject any request that attempts to
     * access your project&#39;s resources if it does not have valid App Check token attached, with some exceptions
     * depending on the service; for example, some services will still allow requests bearing the developer&#39;s
     * privileged service account credentials without an App Check token. App Check metrics continue to be
     * collected to help you detect issues with your App Check integration and monitor the composition of your
     * callers. While the service is protected by App Check, other applicable protections, such as user
     * authorization, continue to be enforced at the same time.
     * Use caution when choosing to enforce App Check on a Firebase service. If your users have not updated
     * to an App Check capable version of your app, their apps will no longer be able to use your Firebase
     * services that are enforcing App Check. App Check metrics can help you decide whether to enforce App
     * Check on your Firebase services.
     * If your app has not launched yet, you should enable enforcement immediately, since there are no outdated
     * clients in use.
     * Possible values are: `UNENFORCED`, `ENFORCED`.
