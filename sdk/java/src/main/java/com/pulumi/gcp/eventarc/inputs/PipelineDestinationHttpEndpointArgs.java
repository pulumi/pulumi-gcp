    /**
     * The CEL expression used to modify how the destination-bound HTTP
     * request is constructed.
     * If a binding expression is not specified here, the message
     * is treated as a CloudEvent and is mapped to the HTTP request according
     * to the CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary Content Mode
     * (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
     * In this representation, all fields except the `data` and
     * `datacontenttype` field on the message are mapped to HTTP request
     * headers with a prefix of `ce-`.
     * To construct the HTTP request payload and the value of the content-type
     * HTTP header, the payload format is defined as follows:
     * 1) Use the outputPayloadFormatType on the Pipeline.Destination if it
     *    is set, else:
     * 2) Use the inputPayloadFormatType on the Pipeline if it is set,
     *    else:
     * 3) Treat the payload as opaque binary data.
     *    The `data` field of the message is converted to the payload format or
     *    left as-is for case 3) and then attached as the payload of the HTTP
     *    request. The `content-type` header on the HTTP request is set to the
     *    payload format type or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation
     *    has updated the `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is
     *    not the same as the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the
     *    payload format type, then the `content-type` header on the HTTP request
     *    is set to this `datacontenttype` value. For example, if the
     *    `datacontenttype` is &#34;application/json&#34; and the payload format type is
     *    &#34;application/json; charset=utf-8&#34;, then the `content-type` header on
     *    the HTTP request is set to &#34;application/json; charset=utf-8&#34;.
     *    If a non-empty binding expression is specified then this expression is
     *    used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
     *    Content representation.
     *    The result of the CEL expression must be a map of key/value pairs
     *    which is used as follows:
     * - If a map named `headers` exists on the result of the expression,
     *   then its key/value pairs are directly mapped to the HTTP request
     *   headers. The headers values are constructed from the corresponding
     *   value type&#39;s canonical representation. If the `headers` field doesn&#39;t
     *   exist then the resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the
     *   CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the final
     *   message. Note: If the specified binding expression, has updated the
     *   `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not the same as
     *   the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the payload format
     *   type, then the `content-type` header in the `headers` map is set to
     *   this `datacontenttype` value.
     * - If a field named `body` exists on the result of the expression then
     *   its value is directly mapped to the body of the request. If the value
     *   of the `body` field is of type bytes or string then it is used for
     *   the HTTP request body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is
     *   of any other type then it is converted to a JSON string. If the body
     *   field does not exist then the resulting payload of the HTTP request
     *   will be data value of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
     *   representation of the final message as described earlier.
     * - Any other fields in the resulting expression will be ignored.
     *   The CEL expression may access the incoming CloudEvent message in its
     *   definition, as follows:
     * - The `data` field of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
     *   using the `message.data` value. Subfields of `message.data` may also be
     *   accessed if an inputPayloadFormat has been specified on the Pipeline.
     * - Each attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
     *   using the `message.` value, where  is replaced with the
     *   name of the attribute.
     * - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression using the
     *   `headers` variable. The `headers` variable defines a map of key/value
     *   pairs corresponding to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding
     *   Binary Content Mode representation of the final message as described
     *   earlier. For example, the following CEL expression can be used to
     *   construct an HTTP request by adding an additional header to the HTTP
     *   headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
     *   representation of the final message and by overwriting the body of the
     *   request:
     * - The default binding for the message payload can be accessed using the
     *   `body` variable. It conatins a string representation of the message
     *   payload in the format specified by the `outputPayloadFormat` field.
     *   If the `inputPayloadFormat` field is not set, the `body`
     *   variable contains the same message payload bytes that were published.
     *   Additionally, the following CEL extension functions are provided for
     *   use in this CEL expression:
     * - toBase64Url:
     *   map.toBase64Url() &gt; string
     * - Converts a CelValue to a base64url encoded string
     * - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() &gt; string
     * - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string
     * - merge:
     *   map1.merge(map2) &gt; map3
     * - Merges the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the
     *   function is applied to.
     * - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key&#39;s value is type
     *   map both maps are merged else the value from the passed map is
     *   used.
     * - denormalize:
     *   map.denormalize() &gt; map
     * - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every value of type map or key
     *   in the map is expanded to return a single level map.
     * - The resulting keys are &#34;.&#34; separated indices of the map keys.
     * - For example:
     *   {
     *   &#34;a&#34;: 1,
     *   &#34;b&#34;: {
     *   &#34;c&#34;: 2,
     *   &#34;d&#34;: 3
     *   }
     *   &#34;e&#34;: [4, 5]
     *   }
     *   .denormalize()
     * &gt; {
     * &#34;a&#34;: 1,
     * &#34;b.c&#34;: 2,
     * &#34;b.d&#34;: 3,
     * &#34;e.0&#34;: 4,
     * &#34;e.1&#34;: 5
     * }
     * - setField:
     *   map.setField(key, value) &gt; message
     * - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
     *   given value.
     * - If the field is not present it will be added.
     * - If the field is present it will be overwritten.
     * - The key can be a dot separated path to set a field in a nested
     *   message.
     * - Key must be of type string.
     * - Value may be any valid type.
     * - removeFields:
     *   map.removeFields([key1, key2, ...]) &gt; message
     * - Removes the fields of the map with the given keys.
     * - The keys can be a dot separated path to remove a field in a
     *   nested message.
     * - If a key is not found it will be ignored.
     * - Keys must be of type string.
     * - toMap:
     *   [map1, map2, ...].toMap() &gt; map
     * - Converts a CEL list of CEL maps to a single CEL map
     * - toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:
     *   message.toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat() &gt; map
     * - Converts a message to the corresponding structure of JSON
     *   format for CloudEvents.
     * - It converts `data` to destination payload format
     *   specified in `outputPayloadFormat`. If `outputPayloadFormat` is
     *   not set, the data will remain unchanged.
     * - It also sets the corresponding datacontenttype of
     *   the CloudEvent, as indicated by
     *   `outputPayloadFormat`. If no
     *   `outputPayloadFormat` is set it will use the value of the
     *   &#34;datacontenttype&#34; attribute on the CloudEvent if present, else
     *   remove &#34;datacontenttype&#34; attribute.
     * - This function expects that the content of the message will
     *   adhere to the standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn&#39;t then this
     *   function will fail.
     * - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
     *   representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data to a JSON
     *   string it can be chained with the toJsonString function.
     *   The Pipeline expects that the message it receives adheres to the
     *   standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn&#39;t then the outgoing message
     *   request may fail with a persistent error.

         *   the HTTP request body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is
         *   of any other type then it is converted to a JSON string. If the body
         *   field does not exist then the resulting payload of the HTTP request
         *   will be data value of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
         *   representation of the final message as described earlier.
         * - Any other fields in the resulting expression will be ignored.
         *   The CEL expression may access the incoming CloudEvent message in its
         *   definition, as follows:
         * - The `data` field of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
         *   using the `message.data` value. Subfields of `message.data` may also be
         *   accessed if an inputPayloadFormat has been specified on the Pipeline.
         * - Each attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
         *   using the `message.` value, where  is replaced with the
         *   name of the attribute.
         * - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression using the
         *   `headers` variable. The `headers` variable defines a map of key/value
         *   pairs corresponding to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding
         *   Binary Content Mode representation of the final message as described
         *   earlier. For example, the following CEL expression can be used to
         *   construct an HTTP request by adding an additional header to the HTTP
         *   headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
         *   representation of the final message and by overwriting the body of the
         *   request:
         * - The default binding for the message payload can be accessed using the
         *   `body` variable. It conatins a string representation of the message
         *   payload in the format specified by the `outputPayloadFormat` field.
         *   If the `inputPayloadFormat` field is not set, the `body`
         *   variable contains the same message payload bytes that were published.
         *   Additionally, the following CEL extension functions are provided for
         *   use in this CEL expression:
         * - toBase64Url:
         *   map.toBase64Url() &gt; string
         * - Converts a CelValue to a base64url encoded string
         * - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() &gt; string
         * - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string
         * - merge:
         *   map1.merge(map2) &gt; map3
         * - Merges the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the
         *   function is applied to.
         * - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key&#39;s value is type
         *   map both maps are merged else the value from the passed map is
         *   used.
         * - denormalize:
         *   map.denormalize() &gt; map
         * - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every value of type map or key
         *   in the map is expanded to return a single level map.
         * - The resulting keys are &#34;.&#34; separated indices of the map keys.
         * - For example:
         *   {
         *   &#34;a&#34;: 1,
         *   &#34;b&#34;: {

         * &#34;e.0&#34;: 4,
         * &#34;e.1&#34;: 5
         * }
         * - setField:
         *   map.setField(key, value) &gt; message
         * - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
         *   given value.
         * - If the field is not present it will be added.
         * - If the field is present it will be overwritten.
         * - The key can be a dot separated path to set a field in a nested
         *   message.
         * - Key must be of type string.
         * - Value may be any valid type.
         * - removeFields:
         *   map.removeFields([key1, key2, ...]) &gt; message
         * - Removes the fields of the map with the given keys.
         * - The keys can be a dot separated path to remove a field in a
         *   nested message.
         * - If a key is not found it will be ignored.
         * - Keys must be of type string.
         * - toMap:
         *   [map1, map2, ...].toMap() &gt; map
         * - Converts a CEL list of CEL maps to a single CEL map
         * - toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:
         *   message.toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat() &gt; map
         * - Converts a message to the corresponding structure of JSON
         *   format for CloudEvents.
         * - It converts `data` to destination payload format
         *   specified in `outputPayloadFormat`. If `outputPayloadFormat` is
         *   not set, the data will remain unchanged.
         * - It also sets the corresponding datacontenttype of
         *   the CloudEvent, as indicated by
         *   `outputPayloadFormat`. If no
         *   `outputPayloadFormat` is set it will use the value of the
         *   &#34;datacontenttype&#34; attribute on the CloudEvent if present, else
         *   remove &#34;datacontenttype&#34; attribute.
         * - This function expects that the content of the message will
         *   adhere to the standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn&#39;t then this
         *   function will fail.
         * - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
         *   representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data to a JSON
         *   string it can be chained with the toJsonString function.
         *   The Pipeline expects that the message it receives adheres to the
         *   standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn&#39;t then the outgoing message

         * request is constructed.
         * If a binding expression is not specified here, the message
         * is treated as a CloudEvent and is mapped to the HTTP request according
         * to the CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary Content Mode
         * (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
         * In this representation, all fields except the `data` and
         * `datacontenttype` field on the message are mapped to HTTP request
         * headers with a prefix of `ce-`.
         * To construct the HTTP request payload and the value of the content-type
         * HTTP header, the payload format is defined as follows:
         * 1) Use the outputPayloadFormatType on the Pipeline.Destination if it
         *    is set, else:
         * 2) Use the inputPayloadFormatType on the Pipeline if it is set,
         *    else:
         * 3) Treat the payload as opaque binary data.
         *    The `data` field of the message is converted to the payload format or
         *    left as-is for case 3) and then attached as the payload of the HTTP
         *    request. The `content-type` header on the HTTP request is set to the
         *    payload format type or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation
         *    has updated the `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is
         *    not the same as the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the
         *    payload format type, then the `content-type` header on the HTTP request
         *    is set to this `datacontenttype` value. For example, if the

         *    &#34;application/json; charset=utf-8&#34;, then the `content-type` header on

         *    If a non-empty binding expression is specified then this expression is
         *    used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
         *    Content representation.
         *    The result of the CEL expression must be a map of key/value pairs

         *   then its key/value pairs are directly mapped to the HTTP request
         *   headers. The headers values are constructed from the corresponding
         *   value type&#39;s canonical representation. If the `headers` field doesn&#39;t
         *   exist then the resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the
         *   CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the final
         *   message. Note: If the specified binding expression, has updated the
         *   `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not the same as
         *   the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the payload format
         *   type, then the `content-type` header in the `headers` map is set to
         *   this `datacontenttype` value.
         * - If a field named `body` exists on the result of the expression then
         *   its value is directly mapped to the body of the request. If the value
         *   of the `body` field is of type bytes or string then it is used for
         *   the HTTP request body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is
