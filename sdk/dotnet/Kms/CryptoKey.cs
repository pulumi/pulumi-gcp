    /// A `CryptoKey` represents a logical key that can be used for cryptographic operations.

    /// &gt; **Note:** CryptoKeys cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.

    /// and delete all CryptoKeyVersions, rendering the key unusable, but *will

    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Kms Crypto Key Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;

    /// using Pulumi;
