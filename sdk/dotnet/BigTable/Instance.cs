    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/admin/rest/v2/projects.instances.clusters)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs)

    /// &gt; **Note**: It is strongly recommended to set `lifecycle { PreventDestroy = true }`
