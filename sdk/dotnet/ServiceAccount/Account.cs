    /// <summary>
    /// Allows management of a Google Cloud service account.
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts)
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Warning:**  If you delete and recreate a service account, you must reapply any IAM roles that it had before.
    /// 
    /// &gt; Creation of service accounts is eventually consistent, and that can lead to
    /// errors when you try to apply ACLs to service accounts immediately after
    /// creation.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// This snippet creates a service account in a project.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var serviceAccount = new Gcp.ServiceAccount.Account("service_account", new()
    ///     {
    ///         AccountId = "service-account-id",
    ///         DisplayName = "Service Account",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Service accounts can be imported using their URI, e.g.
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project_id}}/serviceAccounts/{{email}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, service accounts can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:serviceaccount/account:Account default projects/{{project_id}}/serviceAccounts/{{email}}
    /// ```
