    /// <summary>
    /// When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity. This resource is to add iam policy bindings to a service account resource, such as allowing the members to run operations as or modify the service account. To configure permissions for a service account on other GCP resources, use the google_project_iam set of resources.
    /// 
    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a service account. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service account and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service account are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the service account are preserved.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding` and `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Service account IAM resources can be imported using the project, service account email, role, member identity, and condition (beta).
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:serviceAccount/iAMMember:IAMMember admin-account-iam projects/{your-project-id}/serviceAccounts/{your-service-account-email}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:serviceAccount/iAMMember:IAMMember admin-account-iam "projects/{your-project-id}/serviceAccounts/{your-service-account-email} roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:serviceAccount/iAMMember:IAMMember admin-account-iam "projects/{your-project-id}/serviceAccounts/{your-service-account-email} roles/editor user:foo@example.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  -&gt; **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`. With conditions
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:serviceAccount/iAMMember:IAMMember admin-account-iam "projects/{your-project-id}/serviceAccounts/{your-service-account-email} roles/iam.serviceAccountUser expires_after_2019_12_31"
