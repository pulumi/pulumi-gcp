    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud IoT Core DeviceRegistry. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.iot.RegistryIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the deviceregistry and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.iot.RegistryIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the deviceregistry are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.iot.RegistryIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the deviceregistry are preserved.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.iot.RegistryIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.iot.RegistryIamBinding` and `gcp.iot.RegistryIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.iot.RegistryIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.iot.RegistryIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
