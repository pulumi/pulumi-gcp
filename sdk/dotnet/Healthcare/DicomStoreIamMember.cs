    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Healthcare DICOM store. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the DICOM store and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the DICOM store are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the DICOM store are preserved.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamBinding` and `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.healthcare.DicomStoreIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.
    /// 
    /// This member resource can be imported using the `dicom_store_id`, role, and account e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:healthcare/dicomStoreIamMember:DicomStoreIamMember dicom_store_iam "your-project-id/location-name/dataset-name/dicom-store-name roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role.
    /// 
    /// This binding resource can be imported using the `dicom_store_id` and role, e.g.
    ///
