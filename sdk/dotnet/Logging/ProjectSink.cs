    /// &gt; You can specify exclusions for log sinks created by terraform by using the exclusions field of `gcp.logging.FolderSink`
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** You must have [granted the "Logs Configuration Writer"](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control) IAM role (`roles/logging.configWriter`) to the credentials used with this provider.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** You must [enable the Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** The `_Default` and `_Required` logging sinks are automatically created for a given project and cannot be deleted. Creating a resource of this type will acquire and update the resource that already exists at the desired location. These sinks cannot be removed so deleting this resource will remove the sink config from your terraform state but will leave the logging sink unchanged. The sinks that are currently automatically created are "_Default" and "_Required".
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Basic Sink
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var my_sink = new Gcp.Logging.ProjectSink("my-sink", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my-pubsub-instance-sink",
    ///         Destination = "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/topics/instance-activity",

    ///         UniqueWriterIdentity = true,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ### Cloud Storage Bucket Destination
    /// 
    /// A more complete example follows: this creates a compute instance, as well as a log sink that logs all activity to a
    /// cloud storage bucket. Because we are using `UniqueWriterIdentity`, we must grant it access to the bucket.
    /// 
    /// Note that this grant requires the "Project IAM Admin" IAM role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`) granted to the
    /// credentials used with Terraform.
