    /// Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a project. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the project and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the project are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.projects.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the project are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`, `gcp.projects.IAMMember`, or `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** It is not possible to grant the `roles/owner` role using any of these resources due to this being disallowed by the underlying `projects.setIamPolicy` API method. See the method [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy) for full details. It is, however, possible to remove all owners from the project by passing in an empty `members = []` list to the `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resource. This is useful for removing the owner role from a project upon creation, however, precautions should be taken to avoid inadvertently locking oneself out of a project such as by granting additional roles to alternate entities.
