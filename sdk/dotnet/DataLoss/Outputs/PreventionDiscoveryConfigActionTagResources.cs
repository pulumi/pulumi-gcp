For example, in conjunction with an [IAM deny policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview), you can deny all principals a permission if a tag value is present, mitigating the risk of the resource. This also lowers the data risk of resources at the lower levels of the resource hierarchy. For example, reducing the data risk of a table data profile also reduces the data risk of the constituent column data profiles.
