A top-k of 1 means the selected token is the most probable among all tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-k of 3 means that the next token is selected from among the 3 most probable tokens (using temperature). For each token selection step, the top K tokens with the highest probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on topP with the final token selected using temperature sampling. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. Acceptable value is [1, 40], default to 40.

Tokens are selected from most K (see topK parameter) probable to least until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-p value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-p value is 0.5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token (using temperature) and doesn't consider C. The default top-p value is 0.95. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses. Acceptable value is [0.0, 1.0], default to 0.95.
