    /// 
    /// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}} * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}} * {{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}} * {{workstation_id}} Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration. Cloud Workstations workstation IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member. IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
