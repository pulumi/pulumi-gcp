        /// return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage
        /// is considered an error.

        /// from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from
        /// the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired
        /// state, the `enforce` stage will not be run.
