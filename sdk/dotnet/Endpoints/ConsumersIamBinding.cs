    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Endpoints ServiceConsumers. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the serviceconsumers and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the serviceconsumers are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the serviceconsumers are preserved.
    /// 
    /// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the serviceconsumers
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamBinding` and `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.endpoints.ConsumersIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:
    /// 
    /// * services/{{service_name}}/consumers/{{consumer_project}}
    /// 
    /// * {{service_name}}/{{consumer_project}}
    /// 
    /// * {{consumer_project}}
    /// 
    /// Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration.
    /// 
    /// Cloud Endpoints serviceconsumers IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member.
    /// 
    /// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:endpoints/consumersIamBinding:ConsumersIamBinding editor "services/{{service_name}}/consumers/{{consumer_project}} roles/servicemanagement.serviceController user:jane@example.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers: the resource in question and the role, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:endpoints/consumersIamBinding:ConsumersIamBinding editor "services/{{service_name}}/consumers/{{consumer_project}} roles/servicemanagement.serviceController"
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:endpoints/consumersIamBinding:ConsumersIamBinding editor services/{{service_name}}/consumers/{{consumer_project}}
    /// ```
