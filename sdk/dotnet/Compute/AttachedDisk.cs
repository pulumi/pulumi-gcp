    /// <summary>
    /// Persistent disks can be attached to a compute instance using the `attached_disk`
    /// section within the compute instance configuration.
    /// However there may be situations where managing the attached disks via the compute
    /// instance config isn't preferable or possible, such as attaching dynamic
    /// numbers of disks using the `count` variable.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about attaching disks, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/attachDisk)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Adding a persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk)
    /// 
    /// **Note:** When using `gcp.compute.AttachedDisk` you **must** use `lifecycle.ignore_changes = ["attached_disk"]` on the `gcp.compute.Instance` resource that has the disks attached. Otherwise the two resources will fight for control of the attached disk block.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var defaultInstance = new Gcp.Compute.Instance("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "attached-disk-instance",
    ///         MachineType = "e2-medium",
    ///         Zone = "us-west1-a",
    ///         BootDisk = new Gcp.Compute.Inputs.InstanceBootDiskArgs
    ///         {
    ///             InitializeParams = new Gcp.Compute.Inputs.InstanceBootDiskInitializeParamsArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Image = "debian-cloud/debian-11",
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///         NetworkInterfaces = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Gcp.Compute.Inputs.InstanceNetworkInterfaceArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Network = "default",
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///     });

    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Compute.AttachedDisk("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Disk = defaultGoogleComputeDisk.Id,
    ///         Instance = defaultInstance.Id,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Attached Disk can be imported the following ways:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/instances/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{project}}/{{zone}}/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, Attached Disk can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/attachedDisk:AttachedDisk default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/instances/{{instance.name}}/{{disk.name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
