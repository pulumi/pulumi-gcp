    /// * `gcp.compute.ImageIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the image are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.compute.ImageIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the image are preserved.
