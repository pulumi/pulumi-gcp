    /// Hierarchical firewall policy rules let you create and enforce a consistent firewall policy across your organization. Rules can explicitly allow or deny connections or delegate evaluation to lower level policies. Policies can be created within organizations or folders.
    /// 
    /// This resource should be generally be used with `gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyAssociation` and `gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyRule`
    /// 
    /// For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewall-policies)
    /// 
    /// To get more information about FirewallPolicy, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/firewallPolicies)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Firewall Policy
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Compute.FirewallPolicy("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Parent = "organizations/123456789",
    ///         ShortName = "my-policy",
    ///         Description = "Example Resource",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// FirewallPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, FirewallPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicy:FirewallPolicy default locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicy:FirewallPolicy default {{name}}
    /// ```
