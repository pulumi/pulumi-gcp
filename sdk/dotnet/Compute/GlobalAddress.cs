    ///     * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Global Address Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    ///         Name = "global-appserver-ip",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// ### Global Address Private Services Connect
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var network = new Gcp.Compute.Network("network", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my-network-name",
    ///         AutoCreateSubnetworks = false,
    ///     });

    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Compute.GlobalAddress("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "global-psconnect-ip",
    ///         AddressType = "INTERNAL",

    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// GlobalAddress can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/global/addresses/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, GlobalAddress can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default projects/{{project}}/global/addresses/{{name}}
