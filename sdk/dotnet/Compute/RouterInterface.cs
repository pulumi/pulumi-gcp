    /// and
    /// [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/routers).
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Router interfaces can be imported using the `project` (optional), `region`, `router`, and `name`, e.g.
    /// 
    /// * `{{project_id}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, router interfaces can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerInterface:RouterInterface default {{project_id}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerInterface:RouterInterface default {{region}}/{{router}}/{{name}}
