        /// used.
        /// Note that specifying the same policy more than once for a backend is
        /// not a valid configuration and will be rejected.
        /// The possible values are:
        /// * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
        /// is selected in round robin order.
        /// * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
        /// hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
        /// * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
        /// hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
        /// addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
        /// 1/N of the requests.
        /// * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
        /// * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
        /// connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
        /// to the same address as the destination address of
        /// the incoming connection before the connection
        /// was redirected to the load balancer.
        /// * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
        /// Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
        /// build times and host selection times. For more information about
        /// Maglev, refer to &lt;https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824&gt;
