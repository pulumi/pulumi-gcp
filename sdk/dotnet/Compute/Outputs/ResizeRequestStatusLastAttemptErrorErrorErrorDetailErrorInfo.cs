When identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units should be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than {"instanceLimit": "100/request"}, should be returned as, {"instanceLimitPerRequest": "100"}, if the client exceeds the number of instances that can be created in a single (batch) request.
