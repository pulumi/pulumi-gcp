    /// Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
    /// They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
    /// as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.
    /// 
    /// Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
    /// do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
    /// as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
    /// though existing connections will continue. The health check will
    /// continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
    /// successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
    /// healthy again and can receive new connections.
