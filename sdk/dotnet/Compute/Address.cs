    /// Represents an Address resource.
    /// 
    /// Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
    /// optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
    /// the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
    /// communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
    /// you must specify the instance's external IP address.
    /// 
    /// Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
    /// the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
    /// the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
    /// Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
    /// static.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about Address, see:
