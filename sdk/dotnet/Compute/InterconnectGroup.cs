    /// An interconnect group resource allows customers to create, analyze, and
    /// expand their redundant connections.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about InterconnectGroup, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnects)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Create a Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Interconnect Group Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example_interconnect_group = new Gcp.Compute.InterconnectGroup("example-interconnect-group", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "example-interconnect-group",
    ///         Intent = new Gcp.Compute.Inputs.InterconnectGroupIntentArgs
    ///         {
    ///             TopologyCapability = "NO_SLA",
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// InterconnectGroup can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectGroups/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, InterconnectGroup can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectGroup:InterconnectGroup default projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectGroups/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectGroup:InterconnectGroup default {{project}}/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/interconnectGroup:InterconnectGroup default {{name}}
