    /// Allows associating hierarchical firewall policies with the target where they are applied. This allows creating policies and rules in a different location than they are applied.

    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/firewallPolicies/addAssociation)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Firewall Policy Association
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var folder = new Gcp.Organizations.Folder("folder", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "my-folder",
    ///         Parent = "organizations/123456789",
    ///         DeletionProtection = false,
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var policy = new Gcp.Compute.FirewallPolicy("policy", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Parent = "organizations/123456789",
    ///         ShortName = "my-policy",
    ///         Description = "Example Resource",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Compute.FirewallPolicyAssociation("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         FirewallPolicy = policy.Id,
    ///         AttachmentTarget = folder.Name,

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// FirewallPolicyAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{firewall_policy}}/associations/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{firewall_policy}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, FirewallPolicyAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyAssociation:FirewallPolicyAssociation default locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{firewall_policy}}/associations/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicyAssociation:FirewallPolicyAssociation default {{firewall_policy}}/{{name}}
    /// ```
