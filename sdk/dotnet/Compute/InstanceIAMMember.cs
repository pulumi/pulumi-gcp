    /// * `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.

    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMBinding` and `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
