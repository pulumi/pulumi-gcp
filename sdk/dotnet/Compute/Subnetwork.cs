    /// A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
    /// that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
    /// provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
    /// instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
    /// other network-related resources.
    /// 
    /// Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
    /// global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
    /// instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
    /// private IP addresses.
    /// 
    /// Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
    /// within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
    /// a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
    /// space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
    /// When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
    /// instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.
    /// 
    /// Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
    /// instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
    /// region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
    /// of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.
    ///
