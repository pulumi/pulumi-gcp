    /// An HttpHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
    /// individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTP.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** gcp.compute.HttpHealthCheck is a legacy health check.
    /// The newer [gcp.compute.HealthCheck](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html)
    /// should be preferred for all uses except
    /// [Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
    /// which still require the legacy version.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about HttpHealthCheck, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/httpHealthChecks)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Adding Health Checks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks#legacy_health_checks)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Http Health Check Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Compute.HttpHealthCheck("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "authentication-health-check",
    ///         RequestPath = "/health_check",
    ///         TimeoutSec = 1,
    ///         CheckIntervalSec = 1,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// HttpHealthCheck can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/global/httpHealthChecks/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, HttpHealthCheck can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpHealthCheck:HttpHealthCheck default projects/{{project}}/global/httpHealthChecks/{{name}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpHealthCheck:HttpHealthCheck default {{project}}/{{name}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/httpHealthCheck:HttpHealthCheck default {{name}}
    /// ```
