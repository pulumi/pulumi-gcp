    /// Organization security policies are used to control incoming/outgoing traffic.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about OrganizationSecurityPolicy, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizationSecurityPolicies)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Creating a firewall policy](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewall-policies#create-policy)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Organization Security Policy Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var policy = new Gcp.Compute.OrganizationSecurityPolicy("policy", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ShortName = "my-short-name",
    ///         Parent = "organizations/123456789",
    ///         Type = "CLOUD_ARMOR",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}`
    /// * `{{policy_id}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/organizationSecurityPolicy:OrganizationSecurityPolicy default locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/organizationSecurityPolicy:OrganizationSecurityPolicy default {{policy_id}}
    /// ```
