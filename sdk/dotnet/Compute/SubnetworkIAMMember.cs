    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Compute Engine Subnetwork. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the subnetwork and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the subnetwork are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the subnetwork are preserved.
    /// 
    /// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the subnetwork
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding` and `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.SubnetworkIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:**  This resource supports IAM Conditions but they have some known limitations which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview#limitations). Please review this article if you are having issues with IAM Conditions.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{name}} * {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}} * {{region}}/{{name}} * {{name}} Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration. Compute Engine subnetwork IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member. IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMMember:SubnetworkIAMMember editor "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}} roles/compute.networkUser user:jane@example.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question and the role, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMMember:SubnetworkIAMMember editor "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}} roles/compute.networkUser"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetworkIAMMember:SubnetworkIAMMember editor projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{subnetwork}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  -&gt; **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
    ///
