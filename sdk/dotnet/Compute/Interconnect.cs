    ///     * [Create a Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Compute Interconnect Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var project = Gcp.Organizations.GetProject.Invoke();
    /// 
    ///     var example_interconnect = new Gcp.Compute.Interconnect("example-interconnect", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "example-interconnect",
    ///         CustomerName = "example_customer",

    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```

    /// ## Import
    ///

    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnects/{{name}}`
    ///
