    /// Represents a Route resource.
    /// 
    /// A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
    /// the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
    /// and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
    /// routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
    /// searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
    /// route.
    /// 
    /// Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
    /// specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
    /// the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
    /// uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
    /// remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
    /// the NextHop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
    /// machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
    /// Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
    /// sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.
    /// 
    /// A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
    /// nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, nextHopVpnTunnel, or
    /// nextHopIlb.
    ///
