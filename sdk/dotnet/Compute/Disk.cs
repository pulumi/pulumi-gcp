    /// Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
    /// the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
    /// hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
    /// performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
    /// hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
    /// 
    /// Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
    /// instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
    /// even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
    /// automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
    /// or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
    /// storage space requirements.
    /// 
    /// Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
    /// affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.
    ///
