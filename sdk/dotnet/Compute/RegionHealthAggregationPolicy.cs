    /// The Health Aggregation Policy specifies how to aggregate the service's constituent source health status to determine an aggregated health status result for the service.  For example, you can specify a criteria such as “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if there are at least 5 healthy backend endpoints”. Or, you can specify a criteria like “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if minimum 60% of endpoints in the Backend are healthy”. The Health Aggregation Policy is applied to each Health Source (e.g. Backend Service) individually.

    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/healthAggregationPolicies)

    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Compute Region Health Aggregation Policy Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var project = Gcp.Organizations.GetProject.Invoke();
    /// 
    ///     var exampleTestHealthAggregationPolicy = new Gcp.Compute.RegionHealthAggregationPolicy("example_test_health_aggregation_policy", new()

    ///         Name = "test-health-aggregation-policy",

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// RegionHealthAggregationPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

    /// * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/healthAggregationPolicies/{{name}}`

    /// * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{region}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, RegionHealthAggregationPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionHealthAggregationPolicy:RegionHealthAggregationPolicy default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/healthAggregationPolicies/{{name}}
    /// ```
