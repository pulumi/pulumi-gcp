    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Network Firewall Policy Full
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// NetworkFirewallPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/global/firewallPolicies/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, NetworkFirewallPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkFirewallPolicy:NetworkFirewallPolicy default projects/{{project}}/global/firewallPolicies/{{name}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:compute/networkFirewallPolicy:NetworkFirewallPolicy default {{project}}/{{name}}
