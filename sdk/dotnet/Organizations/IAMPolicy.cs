    /// Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a organization. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the organization and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the organization are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the organization are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`, `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`, or `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

    ///    The safest alternative is to use multiple `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`
    ///    resources. This resource makes it easy to remove your own access to
    ///    an organization, which will require a call to Google Support to have
    ///    fixed, and can take multiple days to resolve.

    ///    by **importing** your existing policy, and examining the diff very closely.
