    /// Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a organization. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the organization and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the organization are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the organization are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding`, `gcp.organizations.IAMMember`, or `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.
    /// 
    /// This member resource can be imported using the `org_id`, role, and member e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy my_organization "your-orgid roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role.
    /// 
    /// This binding resource can be imported using the `org_id` and role, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy my_organization "your-org-id roles/viewer"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question.
    /// 
    /// This policy resource can be imported using the `org_id`.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy my_organization your-org-id
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy my_organization "your-organization-id foo.googleapis.com"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  -&gt; **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
    /// 
    /// full name of the custom role, e.g. `organizations/{{org_id}}/roles/{{role_id}}`. -&gt; **Conditional IAM Bindings**If you're importing a IAM binding with a condition block, make sure
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iAMPolicy:IAMPolicy to include the title of condition, e.g. `google_organization_iam_binding.my_organization "your-org-id roles/{{role_id}} condition-title"`
