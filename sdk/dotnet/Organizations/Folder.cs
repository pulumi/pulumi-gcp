    /// Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see

    /// and
    /// [API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).
    /// 
    /// A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.
    /// 
    /// Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
    /// 
    /// The service account used to run Terraform when creating a `gcp.organizations.Folder`
    /// resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator`. See the
    /// [Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
    /// doc for more information.
    /// 
    /// &gt; It may take a while for the attached tag bindings to be deleted after the folder is scheduled to be deleted.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Folders can be imported using the folder's id, e.g.
    /// 
    /// * `folders/{{folder_id}}`
    /// * `{{folder_id}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, Folders can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder default {{folder_id}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder default folders/{{folder_id}}
