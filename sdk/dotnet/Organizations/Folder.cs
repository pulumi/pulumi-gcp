    /// <summary>
    /// Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see
    /// [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)
    /// and
    /// [API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).
    /// 
    /// A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.
    /// 
    /// Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
    /// 
    /// The service account used to run the provider when creating a `gcp.organizations.Folder`
    /// resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator`. See the
    /// [Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
    /// doc for more information.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     // Top-level folder under an organization.
    ///     var department1 = new Gcp.Organizations.Folder("department1", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "Department 1",
    ///         Parent = "organizations/1234567",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     // Folder nested under another folder.
    ///     var team_abc = new Gcp.Organizations.Folder("team-abc", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "Team ABC",
    ///         Parent = department1.Name,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Folders can be imported using the folder's id, e.g. Both syntaxes are valid
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder department1 1234567
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder department1 folders/1234567
