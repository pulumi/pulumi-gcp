    /// Host project registration refers to the registration of a Google cloud project with API hub as a host project.
    /// This is the project where API hub is provisioned.
    /// It acts as the consumer project for the API hub instance provisioned.
    /// Multiple runtime projects can be attached to the host project and these attachments define the scope of API hub.

    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Apihub Host Project Registration Basic

    ///

    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, HostProjectRegistration can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:apihub/hostProjectRegistration:HostProjectRegistration default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/hostProjectRegistrations/{{host_project_registration_id}}
