    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for BigQuery Connection Connection. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the connection and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the connection are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the connection are preserved.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamBinding` and `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.bigquery.ConnectionIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

    /// 
    ///  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question and the role, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/connectionIamPolicy:ConnectionIamPolicy editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}} roles/viewer"
    /// ```
    /// 
    ///  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
    ///
