    /// Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
    /// it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
    /// `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, the
    /// dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
    /// `ignore_changes = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.

    /// To get more information about DatasetAccess, see:
