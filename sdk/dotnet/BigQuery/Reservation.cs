    ///     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Bigquery Reservation Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    ///         Autoscale = new Gcp.BigQuery.Inputs.ReservationAutoscaleArgs
