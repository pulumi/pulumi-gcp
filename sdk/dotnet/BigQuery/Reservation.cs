    /// A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee BigQuery slots to users.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about Reservation, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rest/v1/projects.locations.reservations/create)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Bigquery Reservation Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var reservation = new Gcp.BigQuery.Reservation("reservation", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my-reservation",
    ///         Location = "us-west2",
    ///         SlotCapacity = 0,
    ///         Edition = "STANDARD",
    ///         IgnoreIdleSlots = true,
    ///         Concurrency = 0,
    ///         Autoscale = new Gcp.BigQuery.Inputs.ReservationAutoscaleArgs
    ///         {
    ///             MaxSlots = 100,
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, Reservation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/reservation:Reservation default {{location}}/{{name}}
