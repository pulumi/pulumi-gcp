    /// A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
    /// when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
    /// and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
    /// like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.
    /// 
    /// Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `Type`
    /// and labels to configure that channel. Each `Type` has specific labels that need to be
    /// present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
    /// present for one channel `Type` are often different than those required for another.
    /// Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
    /// and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
    /// labels are required.
    /// 
    /// A list of supported channels per project the `List` endpoint can be
    /// accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
    /// This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)

    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:**  All arguments marked as write-only values will not be stored in the state: `sensitive_labels.auth_token_wo`, `sensitive_labels.password_wo`, `sensitive_labels.service_key_wo`.

    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Notification Channel Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var basic = new Gcp.Monitoring.NotificationChannel("basic", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "Test Notification Channel",
    ///         Type = "email",
    ///         Labels = 
    ///         {
    ///             { "email_address", "fake_email@blahblah.com" },
    ///         },
    ///         ForceDelete = false,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// ### Notification Channel Sensitive
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var @default = new Gcp.Monitoring.NotificationChannel("default", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "Test Slack Channel",
    ///         Type = "slack",
    ///         Labels = 
    ///         {
    ///             { "channel_name", "#foobar" },
    ///         },
    ///         SensitiveLabels = new Gcp.Monitoring.Inputs.NotificationChannelSensitiveLabelsArgs
    ///         {
    ///             AuthToken = "one",
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, NotificationChannel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
