    /// A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes the level of desired good
    /// service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance
    /// goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against
    /// that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners.
    /// Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have
    /// latency below 200 milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar
    /// month return successfully."
    /// 
    /// To get more information about Slo, see:
