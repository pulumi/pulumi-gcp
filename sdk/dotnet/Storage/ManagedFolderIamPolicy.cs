    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Storage ManagedFolder. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the managedfolder and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the managedfolder are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the managedfolder are preserved.
    /// 
    /// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the managedfolder
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamBinding` and `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.storage.ManagedFolderIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
