        /// 
        /// For each Google Cloud project, Google maintains a unique service account which
        /// is used as the identity for various Google Cloud Storage operations, including
        /// operations involving
        /// [customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys)
        /// and those involving
        /// [storage notifications to pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/notification).
        /// This automatic Google service account requires access to the relevant Cloud KMS keys or pub/sub topics, respectively, in order for Cloud Storage to use
        /// these customer-managed resources.
        /// 
        /// The service account has a well-known, documented naming format which is parameterised on the numeric Google project ID.
        /// However, as noted in [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts), it is only created when certain relevant actions occur which
        /// presuppose its existence.
        /// These actions include calling a [Cloud Storage API endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/projects/serviceAccount/get) to yield the
        /// service account's identity, or performing some operations in the UI which must use the service account's identity, such as attempting to list Cloud KMS keys
        /// on the bucket creation page.
        /// 
        /// Use of this data source calls the relevant API endpoint to obtain the service account's identity and thus ensures it exists prior to any API operations
        /// which demand its existence, such as specifying it in Cloud IAM policy.
        /// Always prefer to use this data source over interpolating the project ID into the well-known format for this service account, as the latter approach may cause
        /// provider update errors in cases where the service account does not yet exist.
        /// 
        /// &gt;  When you write provider code which uses features depending on this service account *and* your provider code adds the service account in IAM policy on other resources,
        ///    you must take care for race conditions between the establishment of the IAM policy and creation of the relevant Cloud Storage resource.
        ///    Cloud Storage APIs will require permissions on resources such as pub/sub topics or Cloud KMS keys to exist *before* the attempt to utilise them in a
        ///    bucket configuration, otherwise the API calls will fail.
        ///    You may need to use `depends_on` to create an explicit dependency between the IAM policy resource and the Cloud Storage resource which depends on it.
        ///    See the examples here and in the `gcp.storage.Notification` resource.
        ///
