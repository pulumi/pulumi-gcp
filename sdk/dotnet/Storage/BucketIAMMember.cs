    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Storage Bucket. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.storage.BucketIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the bucket and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.storage.BucketIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the bucket are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.storage.BucketIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the bucket are preserved.
    /// 
    /// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.storage.BucketIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the bucket
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.storage.BucketIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.storage.BucketIamBinding` and `gcp.storage.BucketIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.storage.BucketIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.storage.BucketIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:**  This resource supports IAM Conditions but they have some known limitations which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview#limitations). Please review this article if you are having issues with IAM Conditions.
