    /// 
    /// An owner is an additional user that may manage a verified web site in the
    /// [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/). There
    /// are two types of web resource owners:
    /// 
    /// * Verified owners, which are added to a web resource automatically when it
    ///     is created (i.e., when the resource is verified). A verified owner is
    ///     determined by the identity of the user requesting verification.
    /// * Additional owners, which can be added to the resource by verified owners.
    /// 
    /// `gcp.siteverification.Owner` creates additional owners. If your web site
    /// was verified using the
    /// `gcp.siteverification.WebResource`
    /// resource then you (or the identity was used to create the resource, such as a
    /// service account) are already an owner.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** The email address of the owner must belong to a Google account,
    /// such as a Gmail account, a Google Workspace account, or a GCP service account.
    /// 
    /// Working with site verification requires the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/siteverification`
    /// authentication scope. See the
    /// Google Provider authentication documentation
    /// to learn how to configure additional scopes.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about site owners, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/site-verification/v1/getting_started)
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Site Verification Storage Bucket
    /// 
    /// This example uses the `FILE` verification method to verify ownership of web site hosted
    /// in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Ownership is proved by creating a file with a Google-provided
    /// value in a known location. The user applying this configuration will automatically be
    /// added as a verified owner, and the `gcp.siteverification.Owner` resource will add
    /// `user@example.com` as an additional owner.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var bucket = new Gcp.Storage.Bucket("bucket", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "example-storage-bucket",
    ///         Location = "US",
    ///     });

    /// ```
    /// 
    /// verified owners is to delete the web resource itself.
