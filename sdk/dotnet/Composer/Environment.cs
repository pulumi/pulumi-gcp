    /// <summary>
    /// An environment for running orchestration tasks.
    /// 
    /// Environments run Apache Airflow software on Google infrastructure.
    /// 
    /// To get more information about Environments, see:
    /// 
    /// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/reference/rest/)
    /// * How-to Guides
    ///     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs)
    ///     * [Configuring Shared VPC for Composer Environments](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/managing/configuring-shared-vpc)
    /// * [Apache Airflow Documentation](http://airflow.apache.org/)
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Warning:** We **STRONGLY** recommend you read the [GCP guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to)
    ///   as the Environment resource requires a long deployment process and involves several layers of GCP infrastructure,
    ///   including a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud Storage, and Compute networking resources. Due to limitations of the API,
    ///   This provider will not be able to automatically find or manage many of these underlying resources. In particular:
    ///   * It can take up to one hour to create or update an environment resource. In addition, GCP may only detect some
    ///     errors in configuration when they are used (e.g. ~40-50 minutes into the creation process), and is prone to limited
    ///     error reporting. If you encounter confusing or uninformative errors, please verify your configuration is valid
    ///     against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs against this provider.
    ///   * **Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that do not get cleaned up automatically** on environment
    ///     deletion. [More about Composer's use of Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage).
    ///   * Please review the [known issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/known-issues) for Composer if you are having problems.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ### Basic Usage
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var test = new Gcp.Composer.Environment("test", new Gcp.Composer.EnvironmentArgs
    ///         {
    ///             Region = "us-central1",
    ///         });
    ///     }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// ### With GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies
    /// 
    /// **NOTE** To use custom service accounts, you need to give at least `role/composer.worker` to the service account being used by the GKE Nodes on the Composer project.
    /// You may need to assign additional roles depending on what the Airflow DAGs will be running.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
