    /// Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Network Security ProjectAddressGroup. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the projectaddressgroup and replaces any existing policy already attached.
    /// * `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the projectaddressgroup are preserved.
    /// * `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the projectaddressgroup are preserved.
    /// 
    /// A data source can be used to retrieve policy data in advent you do not need creation
    /// 
    /// * `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamPolicy`: Retrieves the IAM policy for the projectaddressgroup
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamBinding` and `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.networksecurity.AddressGroupIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

    /// * {{location}}/{{name}}
