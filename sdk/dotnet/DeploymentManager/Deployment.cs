    /// <summary>
    /// A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using
    /// a configuration file
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Warning:** This resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
    /// and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in the provider as well
    /// will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
    /// fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
    /// experienced user of both tools.
    /// 
    /// In addition, due to limitations of the API, the provider will treat
    /// deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
    /// than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
    /// `preview=false`).
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Deployment Manager Deployment Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// using Std = Pulumi.Std;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var deployment = new Gcp.DeploymentManager.Deployment("deployment", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my-deployment",
    ///         Target = new Gcp.DeploymentManager.Inputs.DeploymentTargetArgs
    ///         {
    ///             Config = new Gcp.DeploymentManager.Inputs.DeploymentTargetConfigArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Content = Std.File.Invoke(new()
    ///                 {
    ///                     Input = "path/to/config.yml",
    ///                 }).Apply(invoke =&gt; invoke.Result),
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///         Labels = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Gcp.DeploymentManager.Inputs.DeploymentLabelArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Key = "foo",
    ///                 Value = "bar",
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Deployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/deployments/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
    /// * `{{name}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, Deployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default projects/{{project}}/deployments/{{name}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default {{project}}/{{name}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:deploymentmanager/deployment:Deployment default {{name}}
    /// ```
