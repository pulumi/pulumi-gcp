    /// A Saas resource is the top-level representation of a SaaS service managed by a producer. It contains a list of locations where the service is available, which is used by the Rollout system to generate a rollout plan.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
    /// See Provider Versions for more details on beta resources.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Saas Runtime Saas Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = new Gcp.SaaSRuntime.SaaS("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         SaasId = "test-saas",
    ///         Location = "global",
    ///         Locations = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Gcp.SaaSRuntime.Inputs.SaaSLocationArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Name = "us-central1",
    ///             },
    ///             new Gcp.SaaSRuntime.Inputs.SaaSLocationArgs

    ///         },
    ///     });

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Saas can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/saas/{{saas_id}}`
    /// * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{saas_id}}`
    /// * `{{location}}/{{saas_id}}`
    /// 
    /// When using the `pulumi import` command, Saas can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/saaS:SaaS default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/saas/{{saas_id}}
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/saaS:SaaS default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{saas_id}}
