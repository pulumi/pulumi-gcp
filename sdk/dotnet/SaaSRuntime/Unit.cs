    /// A Unit is the fundamental structural building block of a SaaS offering. Each Unit is an instance of a UnitKind. It is a versioned, manageable component of a service that has its own lifecycle, representing elements like infrastructure, workloads, or an entire application stack that a service producer intends to manage as a single entity.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Saas Runtime Unit Basic
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Gcp = Pulumi.Gcp;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    /// ## Import
    ///

    /// 
    /// * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/units/{{unit_id}}`

    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import gcp:saasruntime/unit:Unit default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/units/{{unit_id}}
