// A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using
// a configuration file
//
//
//
// > **Warning:** This resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
// and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in the provider as well
// will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
// fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
// experienced user of both tools.
//
// In addition, due to limitations of the API, the provider will treat
// deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
// than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
// `preview=false`).
