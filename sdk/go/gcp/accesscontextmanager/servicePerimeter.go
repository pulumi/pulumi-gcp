// ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
// and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
// ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
// has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
// Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
// - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
// GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
// Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
// project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
// 
//
