// Creates a Google Bigtable instance. For more information see
// [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) and
// [API](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/go/reference).
//
// ## Example Usage
// ### Production Instance
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
// 	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/sdk/v4/go/gcp/bigtable"
// 	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v2/go/pulumi"
// )
//
// func main() {
// 	pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
// 		_, err := bigtable.NewInstance(ctx, "production_instance", &bigtable.InstanceArgs{
// 			Clusters: bigtable.InstanceClusterArray{
// 				&bigtable.InstanceClusterArgs{
// 					ClusterId:   pulumi.String("tf-instance-cluster"),
// 					NumNodes:    pulumi.Int(1),
// 					StorageType: pulumi.String("HDD"),
// 				},
// 			},
// 			Labels: pulumi.StringMap{
// 				"my-label": pulumi.String("prod-label"),
// 			},
// 		})
// 		if err != nil {
// 			return err
// 		}
// 		return nil
// 	})
// }
// ```
//
// ## Import
//
// Bigtable Instances can be imported using any of these accepted formats
//
// ```sh
//  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}
// ```
//
// ```sh
//  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{name}}
// ```
//
// ```sh
//  $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{name}}
// ```
