// # bigtable.Instance
//
// Creates a Google Bigtable instance. For more information see:
//
// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/admin/rest/v2/projects.instances.clusters)
// * How-to Guides
//   - [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs)
//
// ## Example Usage
//
// ### Simple Instance
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
//
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/sdk/v9/go/gcp/bigtable"
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi"
//
// )
//
//	func main() {
//		pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
//			_, err := bigtable.NewInstance(ctx, "production-instance", &bigtable.InstanceArgs{
//				Name: pulumi.String("tf-instance"),
//				Clusters: bigtable.InstanceClusterArray{
//					&bigtable.InstanceClusterArgs{
//						ClusterId:   pulumi.String("tf-instance-cluster"),
//						NumNodes:    pulumi.Int(1),
//						StorageType: pulumi.String("HDD"),
//					},
//				},
//				Labels: pulumi.StringMap{
//					"my-label": pulumi.String("prod-label"),
//				},
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			return nil
//		})
//	}
//
// ```
//
// ### Replicated Instance
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
//
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/sdk/v9/go/gcp/bigtable"
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi"
//
// )
//
//	func main() {
//		pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
//			_, err := bigtable.NewInstance(ctx, "production-instance", &bigtable.InstanceArgs{
//				Name: pulumi.String("tf-instance"),
//				Clusters: bigtable.InstanceClusterArray{
//					&bigtable.InstanceClusterArgs{
//						ClusterId:   pulumi.String("tf-instance-cluster1"),
//						NumNodes:    pulumi.Int(1),
//						StorageType: pulumi.String("HDD"),
//						Zone:        pulumi.String("us-central1-c"),
//					},
//					&bigtable.InstanceClusterArgs{
//						ClusterId:   pulumi.String("tf-instance-cluster2"),
//						StorageType: pulumi.String("HDD"),
//						Zone:        pulumi.String("us-central1-b"),
//						AutoscalingConfig: &bigtable.InstanceClusterAutoscalingConfigArgs{
//							MinNodes:  pulumi.Int(1),
//							MaxNodes:  pulumi.Int(3),
//							CpuTarget: pulumi.Int(50),
//						},
//					},
//				},
//				Labels: pulumi.StringMap{
//					"my-label": pulumi.String("prod-label"),
//				},
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			return nil
//		})
//	}
//
// ```
//
// ## Import
//
// Bigtable Instances can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
//
// * `projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}`
//
// * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
//
// * `{{name}}`
//
// When using the `pulumi import` command, Bigtable Instances can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
//
// ```sh
// $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}
// ```
//
// ```sh
// $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{name}}
// ```
//
// ```sh
// $ pulumi import gcp:bigtable/instance:Instance default {{name}}
// ```
