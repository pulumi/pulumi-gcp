	// This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service. If logging is
	// enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
	LogConfig BackendServiceLogConfigPtrInput
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
	// comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
	// '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
	// must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool. This field is applicable only when the
	// load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	OutlierDetection BackendServiceOutlierDetectionPtrInput
	// Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the
	// load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.
	PortName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
	// If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
	Project pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, and
	// SSL. The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer types and may result in errors if
	// used with the GA API.
	Protocol pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The security policy associated with this backend service.
	SecurityPolicy pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is not applicable if the protocol is UDP.
	SessionAffinity pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is
	// [1, 86400].
	TimeoutSec pulumi.IntPtrInput
