	// backend service. Defaults to 'EXTERNAL'.
	LoadBalancingScheme pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality. The possible values are - ROUND_ROBIN - This is a
	// simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order. LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which
	// selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash
	// load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a
	// host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
	// ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to
	// the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load
	// balancer. MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash
	// but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, refer to
	// https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable only when the load_balancing_scheme is set to
	// INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	LocalityLbPolicy pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service. If logging is
	// enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
	LogConfig BackendServiceLogConfigPtrInput
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
	// comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
	// '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
	// must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Settings controlling eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool. This field is applicable only when the
	// load_balancing_scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	OutlierDetection BackendServiceOutlierDetectionPtrInput
	// Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance groups referenced by this service. Required when the
	// load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL.
	PortName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
	// If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
	Project pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, and
	// SSL. The default is HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer types and may result in errors if
	// used with the GA API.
	Protocol pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The security policy associated with this backend service.
	SecurityPolicy pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is not applicable if the protocol is UDP.
	SessionAffinity pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is
	// [1, 86400].
	TimeoutSec pulumi.IntPtrInput
