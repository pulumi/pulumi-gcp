// A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
// that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
// provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
// instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
// other network-related resources.
//
// Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
// global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
// instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
// private IP addresses.
//
// Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
// within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
// a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
// space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
// When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
// instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.
//
// Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
// instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
// region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
// of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.
//
//
