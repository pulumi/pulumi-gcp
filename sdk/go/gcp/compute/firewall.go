// Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
// instances.
//
// All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
// firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.
//
// The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
// shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
// automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
// outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
// networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
// you need.
//
// To get more information about Firewall, see:
