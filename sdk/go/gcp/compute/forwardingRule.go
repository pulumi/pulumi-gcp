	Description pulumi.StringPtrOutput `pulumi:"description"`
	// The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of. Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding
	// rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional). When the load balancing scheme is

	// belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
	// internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this

	BackendService pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
	Description pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of. Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding
	// rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional). When the load balancing scheme is
	// EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address
	// must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
	// scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule
	// supports either IPv4 or IPv6. When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
	// belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
	// internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this
	// forwarding rule. An address must be specified by a literal IP address. ~> **NOTE**: While the API allows you to specify
	// various resource paths for an address resource instead, Terraform requires this to specifically be an IP address to
	// avoid needing to fetching the IP address from resource paths on refresh or unnecessary diffs.
	IpAddress pulumi.StringPtrInput
