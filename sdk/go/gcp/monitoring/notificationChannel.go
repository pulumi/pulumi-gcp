// A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
// when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
// and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
// like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.
//
// Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
// and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
// present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
// present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
// Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
// and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
// labels are required.
//
// A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
// accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
// This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
//
// To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:
//
// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
// * How-to Guides
//   - [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)
//   - [Notification Options](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options)
//
// ## Example Usage
//
// ### Notification Channel Basic
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
//
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/sdk/v8/go/gcp/monitoring"
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi"
//
// )
//
//	func main() {
//		pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
//			_, err := monitoring.NewNotificationChannel(ctx, "basic", &monitoring.NotificationChannelArgs{
//				DisplayName: pulumi.String("Test Notification Channel"),
//				Type:        pulumi.String("email"),
//				Labels: pulumi.StringMap{
//					"email_address": pulumi.String("fake_email@blahblah.com"),
//				},
//				ForceDelete: pulumi.Bool(false),
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			return nil
//		})
//	}
//
// ```
// ### Notification Channel Sensitive
//
// ```go
// package main
//
// import (
//
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/sdk/v8/go/gcp/monitoring"
//	"github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v3/go/pulumi"
//
// )
//
//	func main() {
//		pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
//			_, err := monitoring.NewNotificationChannel(ctx, "default", &monitoring.NotificationChannelArgs{
//				DisplayName: pulumi.String("Test Slack Channel"),
//				Type:        pulumi.String("slack"),
//				Labels: pulumi.StringMap{
//					"channel_name": pulumi.String("#foobar"),
//				},
//				SensitiveLabels: &monitoring.NotificationChannelSensitiveLabelsArgs{
//					AuthToken: pulumi.String("one"),
//				},
//			})
//			if err != nil {
//				return err
//			}
//			return nil
//		})
//	}
//
// ```
//
// ## Import
//
// NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
//
// * `{{name}}`
//
// When using the `pulumi import` command, NotificationChannel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
//
// ```sh
// $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/notificationChannel:NotificationChannel default {{name}}
// ```
