// A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
// when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
// and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
// like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.
//
// Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
// and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
// present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
// present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
// Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
// and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
// labels are required.
//
// A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
// accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
// This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
//
//
// To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:

// * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
// * How-to Guides
