// A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes the level of desired good
// service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance
// goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against
// that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners.
// Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have
// latency below 200 milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar
// month return successfully."
//
// To get more information about Slo, see:
